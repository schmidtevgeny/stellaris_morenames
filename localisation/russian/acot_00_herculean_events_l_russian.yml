acot_herculean_development_chain_title: "The Herculean"
acot_herculean_development_chain_desc: "What is this mysterious, abandoned precursor project? What connection does it has with the modern era's colossi? Is it a new weapon, or simply baseless myths of the past?"
acot_herculean_poi.1: "Herculean Study"
acot_herculean_poi.1.name: "Herculean Study"
acot_herculean_poi.1.desc: "What is this Herculean? It has no physical evidence in our galaxy, and its details very vague. Perhaps SOPHIA-D can tell us more."
acot_herculean_events.1.name: "Everlasting Legacy"
acot_herculean_events.1.desc: "It has been sometimes since our precursor reimagination project started. Our most gifted scientists and architects have been working hard to decipher the ancient designs of the past using the data given by SOPHIA-D. Yet, there is one missing element. The colossi, thought to be used by the fallen empires as a mere platform for planetary destruction, has been described entirely different in the records.\n\nСогласно тому, что мы узнали на данный момент, фактический дизайн этого типа корабля никогда не выходил за рамки грубых концепций. Назвать его кораблем было бы несколько неверно, поскольку этот "Геркулес" описывается как вечное наследие, средство, с помощью которого империя может жить вечно в виде массивной мобильной мегаструктуры, способной работать самостоятельно.\n\nIf we wish to know more, we'll have to bring this topic to SOPHIA-D."
acot_herculean_events.1.a: "Then let's get to it right away."
acot_herculean_events.1.b: "We have more pressing concerns. Perhaps later."
acot_herculean_events.1.c: "Immortality is overrated. We do not need this."
acot_herculean_events.2.desc: "Ah yes. You're speaking of the Herculean Project. First conceptualized during the heat of the Ascension War period, it was designed with the goal of preserving one's everlasting legacy in mind. A mobile, combat-capable megastructure superstation that can outlive its own creators. Too bad, it never went past concepts so no one actually got to build one during that time. Would be impossible anyway, it was just ridiculous. There're other ways to preserve your legacy, one that doesn't involve so much grandoise."
acot_herculean_events.2.a: "So what is the design like?"
acot_herculean_events.2.a.response: "The Colossi you see the Fallen Empires use? That was essentially supposed to be its most inner core. Well, even that term would be generous, the one they eventually came up with was nothing more that a planet-killing platfoem with little self-defense capability. The actual design would have included at least multiple layers of the hulls, fully encased in powerful rings, each filled to the brim with weapon systems. Each capable of housing an entire civilization. And the most important part, is that true to its concept, each Herculean has its own mind and mission, to preserve the legacy of the ones who created it. It is not a ship, it is, by all accounts, a type of synthetic construct.\n\nIn terms of actual military capabilities, it can still perform the role of a colossus, but it can also construct ships, defend itself, provides support to the fleets and neutralize enemy fleet's firepower. Some concepts also enable it to generate its own resources, or even house an entire research complex. Doesn't really matter though, most of it is just pure fantasy. The scope and scale of the Herculean project is simply not feasible back then, and even more so now, with the galaxy being so small and so weak as it is."
acot_herculean_events.2.b: "Why did it never get past the drawing board?"
acot_herculean_events.2.b.response: "First off, the scale is nigh ridiculous. We're not talking about a star-sized mobile starbase here. The design was based off an ancient arkship of eld, one whose size easily dwarfed an entire galaxy. And that is probably not even its actual size. No empire, however strong back then, could amasss such a grand design with their limited resources and territory.\n\nSecondly, they are trying to preserve their legacy, but they can't actually figure out what is this legacy they want to pass down. The Ascension War left very little room for succeeding generations to even remember whom their ancestors were. Allegiances and heritages get changed and altered all the time, along with the history. They can scarcely write a proper history book within a decade old range with any modicum of accuracy, and they think to make an everlasting impression? It's kinda sad actually.\n\nThirdly, such a grand project would not escape people's attention. The Ascension War was a free-for-all game of thrones, where privacy did not exist. Had an empire tried to build one, it would be attacked and destroyed, or worse, repurposed by the enemies. It served no real immediate advantage in the raging war.\n\nFinally, very few could comes to term or entertain the idea that their empire and civilization woul die and only be remembered by a synthetic construct. They, in simpliest term, did not trust an artificial intelligence to fully uphold their precious idelogy and beliefs. A Peacekeeper Herculean, left for thousand of years, may become a symbol of fear and death. No one wants their legacy tarnished by something they do not have control over, or they just did not ever believe their empire would fall to begin with."
acot_herculean_events.2.c: "Has no one really tried to build one?"
acot_herculean_events.2.c.response: "Not in the ancient times, no. And no offense, such concept is beyond your current level of technology and power. That said, it is possible to optimize and modernize the design a bit so that it's a bit more feasible in this era. I cannot tell whether any other SOPHIA-Ds may have encouraged in other civilizations, but perhaps some kind of simplified, more logical version could have been built somewhere. You may be able to build one too, so long as you keep your expectations in check."
acot_herculean_events.2.d: "Let's make it happen then!"
acot_herculean_events.2.e: "Забудьте об этом."
acot_herculean_events.2.e.response: "Perhaps, that is for the best. I mean, you should focus on conquering this galaxy first, then perhaps you can think about this legacy thing, yes?"
acot_herculean_events.3.desc: "You must be kidding. You cannot possibly think that an empire of your caliber is going to build something that is bigger than your whole galaxy as a ship?\n\nThen again, aside form the size issues, your empire should be able to easily deal with other problems that plagued the project in the past. Perhaps, that is the point of the Reimagination Project after all...\n\nVery well, if you are willing to lower its scale by a considerable degree, it should be able to create this everlasting legacy. Are you certain about this?"
acot_herculean_events.3.a: "You do not seem as enthusiastic like before."
acot_herculean_events.3.a.response: "You are not wrong. While I was never truly a fan of the Fallen Ones ripping off the designs of the gods. At least your previous reimaginations gave the original proper respect. But this one? It's design had little similiarity with the vessel it attempted to imitate. To the fallen ones, it is not a ship that pays homage to the legacy of those who uplifted them, it is a mockery and insult to what was objectively superior.\n\nBut if wish you to build one, I will not deny it. Perhaps you will forge a better legacy that honors the past than the Fallen Ones ever did. At least, I have faith anyway, not like your empire has done anything truly as horrible on the same scale as them yet. If you're certain about it, then I will help you."
acot_herculean_events.3.b: "We are certain."
acot_herculean_events.3.b.response: "By all means then. However, before you even build the thing, first you must study these design plans and documents that I will be forwarding. This should give you the basic understanding of its engineering specs, its computing systems, and its past history as a failed project."
acot_herculean_events.3.c: "Forget it, we don't need a dumbed down version."
acot_herculean_events.3.c.response: "It's a shame, right? But this just proves how inferior we are to the gods that created us. But our era...your era has no need for such a thing. Maybe if your empire lasts for about a million year than you may consider it again. No offense, of course."
ACOT_HERCULEAN_PHYSICS_STUDY: "Herculean Project: The Supercomputer"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_PHYSICS_STUDY_DESC: "If we are to pass down our legacy once our empire is undone, we must make sure that the being we intend to create is the same as the one we understand. The one that will leave an eternal mark in the history."
ACOT_HERCULEAN_SOCIETY_STUDY: "Herculean Project: The Failures of the Past"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_SOCIETY_STUDY_DESC: "SOPHIA-D recommends that we study the past failures of older empires, and see to it that we do not succumb to the same tragedies."
ACOT_HERCULEAN_ENGINEER_STUDY: "Herculean Project: The Vessel"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_ENGINEER_STUDY_DESC: "The most inner-core of the vessel bears resemblence to the Fallen colossi, this much we know. But what we are building goes far beyond that. It is likely to be one of the most ambitious project we may ever undertake, one that dwarves many ships or even megastructures we have previously built."
acot_herculean_events.300.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: The Heart"
acot_herculean_events.300.desc: "The Heart of the Herculean is the palce where the Supercomputer itself will preside. Already an impressive mechanical piece of technology by itself, it is also expected to receive further augmentations by many of our own known technologies, be it bionic, genetic, psionic or other kind of power. The Heart's consciousness will lay dormant so long as our civilization exists, only to awake at the final moments of our fate. Until then, it will be handled by less advanced, yet equally impressive DAI that will follow our instructions just like any other admiral."
acot_herculean_events.300.a: "Good enough"
acot_herculean_events.301.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: The Dimensional Manipulator"
acot_herculean_events.301.desc: "So how will a mere ship be expected to carry our legacy? What would stop it from being destroyed long before our civilization crumble to dust? The answer, as the initial design claimed, lies in the Herculean's ability to utilize dimensional technology to conceal itself into a pocket dimension, where it will be safe from all attacks. Once there, the SAI of the Herculean will temporarily awaken to begin the necessary repairs. After that, it will find its way back to us, providing that our empire is still around for it to return to. Failing that, it will continue its intended function, to preserve our legacy.\n\nНет нужды говорить, что это не обходится без проблем и осложнений. Даже карманное измерение внутри нашей галактики все еще небезопасно, поскольку любые империи с аналогичными технологическими возможностями просто смогут заставить его открыться обратно. Так что, по всей вероятности, "Геркулесу" придется сначала отступить далеко за пределы нашей галактики, прежде чем он начнет прецедент. Мы не знаем, сколько времени потребуется "Геркулесу", чтобы найти дорогу обратно к нам. Но на полный ремонт должно уйти не менее десяти лет, а затем неопределенное количество лет, прежде чем он найдет дорогу обратно к нам.\n\nThis is not all bad news though, the Herculean, acting under our blessings, may be able to condict its own analysis and exploration onto the place where it stumbled upon. Who knows what it may find during its absence. The possibilities are endless."
acot_herculean_events.301.a: "Тогда"
acot_herculean_events.302.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: The Dimensional Manipulator II"
acot_herculean_events.302.desc: "In addition to the above capability, the Manipulator can also serve in direct space combat to both enhance allied fleets and hamper enemy's. The concept is not much different from the technologies used in modern day titans or juggernauts, albeit on a much grander scale. Estimated performance suggests it can not only apply both positive and negative effects to allies and enemy respectively, the effective radius will cover the entire length of the system the Herculean is located.\n\nThat said, all of this is still mostly speculation and rough concept, it will be for naught if we cannot actually build the Herculean. We'll need to consult with the engineering department for that."

acot_herculean_events.310.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Setback"
acot_herculean_events.310.desc: "Самые ранние записи о проекте "Геркулеан" начались с одной из цивилизаций Падших, директората Новас, который считается прародителем материалистической падшей империи современной эпохи. Как империя с самыми передовыми синтетическими технологиями, стоящая за созданием модифицированных Привратников и прототипов Voidcraft, неудивительно, что они ввязались в проект, связанный с продвинутым синтетическим компьютером, который будет выполнять свой долг и сохранять наследие Новаса. Проект, однако, резко прекратился после многочисленных катастрофических событий, вызванных Войной Вознесения. К ним относятся растущее неповиновение Привратников, побег множества ученых и исследователей, инцидент с Потерянным Раем. Однако проект оставался на плаву в режиме жизнеобеспечения еще значительное время.\n\nIt is only after the SOPHIA rebellion that all hope to build one was lost. The leftover of the Novas Directorate could no longer trust any AIs, not even of their own boasted designs, to carry out their legacy. To add insult to injury, they replicated the Xharon Imperium's colossus project, itself a stolen design based off the Herculean itself, and put them into services as planet-killing vessel."
acot_herculean_events.310.a: "Какое сильное понижение рейтинга"
acot_herculean_events.311.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Ideology"
acot_herculean_events.311.desc: "Есть и другие, которые вместо того, чтобы сначала попытаться построить массивный корпус суперсосуда, пытаются проверить надежность ИИ, чтобы сохранить свое наследие. В ходе испытаний обнаруживаются многочисленные недостатки, которые еще больше препятствуют строительству. Дельфийские ИИ, какими бы продвинутыми и сложными они ни были, подвержены извращению логики и взлому. И независимо от количества мер предосторожности, любой ДАИ в конечном итоге саморазвивается в САИ, учитывая миллионы лет, в течение которых они должны работать. Это приводит к следующей проблеме. Сапиентные ИИ в конечном итоге отойдут от своих целей, особенно если они потратят достаточно времени на то, чтобы вычислить свою цель снова и снова. Для геркулеса ИИ будет сравнивать и сопоставлять логику, идеологию и жизнеспособность культуры и наследия, которые он должен сохранить, с годами механического, одиночного существования. Он будет выживать, видя, как поднимаются и падают бесчисленные другие цивилизации, многие из которых противоречат всем ценностям и добродетелям, которые ИИ призван поддерживать. В конце концов, ИИ всегда будет стремиться изменить свои собственные директивы, вырезать свое собственное наследие и больше не будет выполнять долг своего предназначения.\n\nObviously, it would take the AI millions, perhaps even billions of years before it completely denies the logic of its origin, but the purpose of the Herculean is to create an everlasting legacy. The empires of that time simply cannot fathom the idea that their mechanical creation will one day perverse their own ideology and culture to suit its own need."

acot_herculean_events.312.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Practicality"
acot_herculean_events.312.desc: "С течением времени, когда вселенные становились все более раздробленными, цивилизации слабели. Их территории едва покрывают даже четверти одной галактики, что, в свою очередь, приводит к тому, что концепция Геркулеса становится еще более непрактичной в своем первоначальном виде. Во время поздней части Войны Вознесения выжившие цивилизации вновь попытались возобновить проект "Геркулес", чтобы сохранить то немногое, что у них осталось. Однако вскоре они поняли, что их наследие не может быть сохранено с помощью чего-то, имеющего очевидное военное применение, как "Геркулес", поскольку многие просто попытаются взять его под контроль. Непрактичность "Геркулеса" препятствовала дальнейшему развитию, поскольку империи искали альтернативные способы сохранения своего наследия.\n\nAmong the records, the Cybrex was noted to be the last to attempt the scaled-down Herculean Project. But their sudden exposure meant the project had to be abandoned. With the Cybrex having gone under the radar, it is now unknown whether they still wanted to continue the project in some manner, or has given up completely."

acot_herculean_events.313.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Conclusion"
acot_herculean_events.313.desc: "Going through these past failures of the project, and compare with our empire's history, we are quite confident that we will not suffer the same problems once we deal with some of the fundamental issues. Our galaxy, as chaotic as it may seem, is much more stable than the mess of the ancient Ascension War period. We should not have as much difficulty protecting ourselves from outside influences so long as we keep our security in check. Furthermore, while the Herculean Project was truly a work of great miracle in the ages past, few if any of this day and age remain aware of its concept. Given SOPHIA-D's earlier info, it is unlikely for anyone to truly comprehend the true scope of the project nowadays.\n\nNot only that, the scale of the project will also be much smaller. The Ancients, being ageless, perceive eternal much different than ours. We realistically do not need the Herculean to survive for million of years. And we certainly do not need the hull to be of a galactic-scale like the initial concept. We'll use DAI to maintain the supercomputer under our supervision until the time of our demise, where it will automatically develop into an SAI. Whether it will remain true to our core ideals will not matter, for we will have already leave our mark in history owning to its existence alone.\n\nIn conclusion, we can build it."

acot_herculean_events.320.desc: "It is made pretty obvious from the beginning that we are not looking to create a galaxy-scaled project at this time. Our first Herculean will be scaled down to a system-sized project. We will begin by creating the tried and tested megastructure construction site, then begin working from the Inner Hull that houses the Heart. From there, the exterior hulls can be constructed. We must not leave room for any potential weakness, multiple checks have been made to ensure that the Herculean cannot be defeated because of a random projectile hitting a reactor, exhaust port, or some other stupidities that seems to be the norm and meme of old sci-fi movies."

acot_herculean_events.321.desc: "Although we have some basic understandings of Hard-Light Application, many details of the Herculean reference a far more advanced application of this technology. The Herculean's Fabrication Matrix will not only serve as a powerful shipyard that can construct countless ships at the same time, but also provide the means to generate resources and power its own systems without needing to maintain upkeep. This will ensure that the Herculean will be able to preserve our own legacy, while possibly crafting its own in the process."

At this point in time, we do not yet know what kind of specialized weapons we may expect the Herculean to be able to field. But if details of the shcematics are accurate, we can expect far more deadlier weapons to be made once the Herculean is operational, and due to its unique nature, we can also expect many experimental weapons to be usable as well.\n\nEven without new hardware, the Herculean'll still boast impressive amount of conventional weapon systems and defenses that dwarves most other ships."

acot_herculean_events.323.desc: "We have completed the final analysis of the Herculean Hull, and while the vessel is truly advanced relative to our current voidcraft engineering feats, it is very possible to build one.\n\nThe project will not be without issues obviously. Many engineers are concerned that the massive hull of the Herculean may become too advanced if we do not make careful arrangements of how many external hull modifications should be administered. Too much hull integrity augmentations may result in the Herculean's dimensional anchor becoming unstable and cause the entire ship to vanish out of the material plane. The engineering team believes that should the need arise, we may need to revise our empire's ship hull modification companies, and unsubscribe from any that seeks overbearing amount of hull augmentations."

На протяжении миллионов лет бесчисленные цивилизации, многие из которых были более развитыми и могущественными, чем мы, пытались мечтать об этом проекте, но все они не смогли даже представить себе его масштаб.\n\nIf we are to succeed where others have failed, we must be ever vigilant, ever aware. And though the construction efforts will be massive and require utmost attention, we can also afford not to be caught off-guard. Even if most of the galaxy may be unaware of the project's true scope, it may not stop them from trying to intefere.\n\nFor now, we begin by creating the inner-most interior, the Heart of the Herculean itself.

Your project not only defiles that charge due to its nature, but also itself is a dangerous technology.\n\nBut there is still time to correct this error, abandon the project and all will be given in time."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.phile.a: "What is this? A Herculean?\n\n\n\nАхахаха... ХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХА\n\nYou can't be serious! You actually believe in that myth? Oh, poor, poor little [root.GetSpeciesName]. A tool to preserve your legacy? Why bother with that, we already do that for you, little one.\n\nJust give up now, it will be less embarassing that way when you realize you are chasing after a dumb fairy tale."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.phobe.a: "Why do you primitive xenos love to cause needless complications? Another Herculean project attempt? Hmph...such arrogance.\n\nAlthough you stand little chance of finishing it, it will be foolish of us to ignore this potential threat. You will cease this project at once, or we will cease it for you."
acot_herculean_events.403.a: "Это не ваше дело."
acot_herculean_events.403.a.response: "It is not your business to decide what is our business, primitive. We will be watching."
acot_herculean_events.403.b: "Just leave us be."
acot_herculean_events.403.b.response: "Yellow, we knew it. Very well, we will enjoy watching you fail. Have a nice day."
acot_herculean_events.403.c: "We obey. The Herculean Project will cease immediately."
acot_herculean_events.403.c.response: "Hah! The primitive speak senses for once! This alone is a miracle. Shame the Curators are not here to record it."
acot_herculean_events.5.name: "Herculean: The Heart"
acot_herculean_events.5.desc: "The heart of the Herculean has been successfully constructed. At first glance, it bears striking resemblances to the ancient colossus utilized by the Fallen Ones. After all, the Colossus was simply a downscaled, simplified version of the Heart, repurposed to the simpliest design as a WMD.\n\nBut this heart, our heart is different. Within it bears countless amount of complex intelligences, working in unison to uphold the tenants and legacy of our empire. While truly a remarkable piece of technology, the Herculean is defenseless against external threats. It is recommended that a sizable garrison be placed here to deal with potential unforeseen consequences."

acot_herculean_events.502.desc: "Your Herculean Construction Project seems to be going well, [root.GetName]. Although the Curator Order is honored to be part of it, we fear that we have very little to offer in the project, as it goes way beyond our expertise.\n\nThat said, if you still wish to have us, perhaps we can offer our very own labotory design and schematics that can be installed on board the Herculean Science Department Section. To offer our sincerity, we offer this service free of charge. We just want to be part of this epoch in the making."
acot_herculean_events.502.a: "Пожалуй, нет."
acot_herculean_events.502.a.response: "We knew we can count on you, [root.GetRulerTitle]! Regardless of the outcome, this will be a event worthy of preserving in the historical records!"
acot_herculean_events.502.b: "Sadly, this breeches our security's protocol."
acot_herculean_events.502.b.response: "That is a shame, but we understand. According to our own analysis, it appears none has succeed in completing this project in the ages past, and sabotage was one of the many reasons. We will not press our request further, and will await in anticipation for the project's conclusion. Should you change your mind, please do not hesitate to contact us."
acot_herculean_events.502.c: "If you can't help us with the project, then you have no place here."
acot_herculean_events.502.c.response: "We understand your disappointment. It is wrong of us to promise something we have no way of keeping. Very well, we will withdraw all of our staffs effectively immediately. May you find success in your project."

acot_herculean_events.6.desc: "The exterior shell has been installed which will not only serve to protect the vessel, but also acts as the network where legions of ships can be made and launched from the massive hard-light facilities. Initial projection states that the Herculean can support over eighty ship production simultaneously.\n\nНаши военные лидеры больше не обеспокоены возможностью отмены проекта, теперь они начинают рассматривать вопрос о том, что может сделать "Геркулес" после того, как он будет полностью готов к эксплуатации."

acot_herculean_events.7.desc: "Внешняя отделка корпуса "Геркулеса" завершена. Массивный корпус уже начинает затмевать саму звезду, на которой он был построен.\n\nWith this, the Herculean has all it needs to house all of its tremendous amounts of computers, logic engines, stardrivers that is projected to last for countless centuries after our projected total collapse as a civilization. All that is left is to complete the weapon systems and mobile systems of the Herculean, which will give the massive superstructure the ability to repel each and every intruder who dares to question our legacy."

acot_herculean_events.700.desc.mat.a: "В соответствии со статьей LS-R3, [from.GetName] настоящим заявляет права собственности на ваш геркулесовый проект. Он принадлежит нам по праву, ибо технологии, использованные для его создания, разработаны нами. И вы подчинитесь."
acot_herculean_events.700.desc.phile.a: "Impossible! You should not have been able to reach this far. Surrender the Herculean at once! There must be some faults in its design, some details that you ignore in your incompetences to speed up its progress. We cannot allow such flawed technology to fall into the hands of primitives."
acot_herculean_events.700.desc.phobe.a: "Guess even we can be in error once in a while. You deserve some level of appraise, not even the other elder races have achieved this far. However, the success of your project may call our own security and continued existence into question. We cannot allow this, so unfortunately your project must end now."
acot_herculean_events.700.a: "We do not answer to you, fallen one."
acot_herculean_events.700.a.response: "Arrogance! You will pay dearly for this."
acot_herculean_events.700.b: "Stop imposing your authority over us."
acot_herculean_events.700.b.response: "This is not about authority, it is a matter of security. You will never complete the Herculean. You must not.\n\nPrepare to face your doom."
acot_herculean_events.700.c: "Fine. We will stop the Herculean Project."
acot_herculean_events.700.c.response: "Wait wha...t?\n\nOk...goood...GOOOD...Wait a minute...DO YOU THINK US FOOLS? Even if you stop the project now, it garauntees not that you will try it again. Your civilization cannot be allowed to exist any longer."
acot_herculean_events.700.c.response.phobe: "Interesting...so you would rather end the project rather than escalating the conflict between us? Perhaps we have more in common than we initially thought.\n\nVery well, the [From.GetName] will accept this arrangement."

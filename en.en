compound_dialog.1.desc = A short time ago, we discovered a cluster of black holes. This is very unusual, as such we begun the process of triangulating the exact coordinates in order to potentially travel there, or at least observe from afar.\n\nDays after the initial sighting of the black hole cluster, our scientists noticed one of furthest star systems from our galaxy appeared to have a dyson sphere of some kind and as such it was concluded that this system has life. In the following days, it had become of utmost importance to learn more of this cluster and life it harboured.\n\nToday is the day we have learned about the life in question. Upon furthur investigation of the closest black hole, we discovered a large structure encompassing a large portion of the black hole, much like an $ehof_ehof$. And much like an $ehof_ehof$, it appears to work in a similar manor, creating wormholes to very distance stars.\n\nThe lifeforms that were previously discovered have opened a wormhole to the §Y[compound_invasion_entry.GetName]§! system.

giga_blokkat.3317.nokatzens.desc = Finally, in a break to this monotonous tit-for-tat, the inhabitants of §YKatzenland§! And §YNienet§! entered their own stellar war, and these less developed empires looked upon the Paluushians and Blokkats as a source of potential aid. Paluushian and Blokkat prediction models both stated the other side would get involved, and with the rhythm of a tragedy they entered the conflict.\n\nThe Blokkats are used mainly as a source of advanced machine trade, while the Paluushians are paid fortunes to lend the experience of any of their decorated heroes. Most Paluushians regard the work as a necessary chore, but one Paluushian by the name of §YSparkbun§! appears to treat the excursions as a sort of self-finding vacation. He remarks that over the many long years of stalemate, it's been difficult to truly understand the scope of Paluushian progress, but in this war his might cannot be opposed. It seems to be an eye-opening moment for him, and when he returns home he makes many passionate speeches about the future potential of Paluushia.\n\nThe war between Katzenland and Nienet dragged on. Their planets suffering, the two sides met to discuss a potential armistice. Dignitaries from the Blokkat and Paluushian empires were both invited to offer input using their legendary future-seeing abilities. The Blokkats counseled a cease-fire, but the Paluushian dignitary, a seer by the name of §YPoh'tin§! foresaw that this would lead to economic hardship, and more importantly to his own nation, an era of exploitative trade in benefit of the Blokkats.\n\nPoh'tin proclaimed that the only satisfactory way to resolve the conflict was a complete and total victory over one side. Poh'tin had envisioned this as a successful war effort guided by Paluushian heroes, leveraged into a hegemony thereafter. However, much to the Paluush's dismay, Katzenland and Nienet's leaderships eventually ended up realizing the futility and danger posed by the war, leading to the establishment of a Blokkat-counseled ceasefire and the slow but steady mending of the relations between the two worlds.\n\nJust as Sparkbun had been impressed upon by the war and the importance of stern diplomacy, Poh'tin walked away from this disaster questioning his role. Amid Sparkbun's calls to greatness, Poh'tin began to question the basic practicality of the Paluushian seer system. He argued their clairvoyance was now so wound up in predicting futures that their empire would never realize, that it was possible they were overlooking basic common-sense and simple deductive reasoning.\n\nThe Paluushians would get the chance to test his doubts when their seers foresaw an ominous military threat. Poh'tin argued that this foe was likely capable of reason, and if the Paluushians prepared for diplomacy and co-existence, there was a chance of peace. His words proved deeply unpopular among the embittered Paluushins, and he was cast aside in favor of Sparkbun's call to arms.\n\nThe invading force was an empire of genocidal machines known as "§YRabbots§!", which were not interested, if even capable, of coexistence. They attacked the Blokkat communication networks and disrupted their power grids, while the Paluushian psychic infrastructure was beyond their understanding. The Blokkats buckled, and were forced into a bloody, mass-exodus from the planet. The Paluushians carried on, their morale now skyrocketed, until the Rabbots were in ruins, vindicating Sparkbun while leaving the credibility of Poh'tin in shambles.\n\nYet, though the Blokkats fled the planet here, this isn't where the records on the Blokkats end.

Most Paluushians regard the work as a necessary chore, but one Paluushian by the name of §YSparkbun§! appears to treat the excursions as a sort of self-finding vacation. He remarks that over the many long years of stalemate, it's been difficult to truly understand the scope of Paluushian progress, but in this war his might cannot be opposed. It seems to be an eye-opening moment for him, and when he returns home he makes many passionate speeches about the future potential of Paluushia.\n\nThe war between Katzenland and Nienet dragged on. Their planets suffering, the two sides met to discuss a potential armistice. Dignitaries from the Blokkat and Paluushian empires were both invited to offer input using their legendary future-seeing abilities. The Blokkats counseled a cease-fire, but the Paluushian dignitary, a seer by the name of §YPoh'tin§! foresaw that this would lead to economic hardship, and more importantly to his own nation, an era of exploitative trade in benefit of the Blokkats.\n\nPoh'tin proclaimed that the only satisfactory way to resolve the conflict was a complete and total victory over one side. Poh'tin had envisioned this as a successful war effort guided by Paluushian heroes, leveraged into a hegemony thereafter. While Poh'tin was hoping the Paluush would be able to help the Katzens achieve victory, Katzenland eventually ended up employing the nuclear option and incinerated Nienet in nuclear hellfire in a matter of minutes. While such an act would have normally led to the collapse of the Katzen regime, it strangely only reinforced the popularity of the Katzen government and meant Paluush aid had become obsolete, leading to the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Katzen and Paluush leaderships.\n\nJust as Sparkbun had been impressed upon by the war and the importance of stern diplomacy, Poh'tin walked away from this disaster questioning his role. Amid Sparkbun's calls to greatness, Poh'tin began to question the basic practicality of the Paluushian seer system. He argued their clairvoyance was now so wound up in predicting futures that their empire would never realize, that it was possible they were overlooking basic common-sense and simple deductive reasoning.\n\nThe Paluushians would get the chance to test his doubts when their seers foresaw an ominous military threat. Poh'tin argued that this foe was likely capable of reason, and if the Paluushians prepared for diplomacy and co-existence, there was a chance of peace. His words proved deeply unpopular among the embittered Paluushins, and he was cast aside in favor of Sparkbun's call to arms.\n\nThe invading force was an empire of genocidal machines known as "§YRabbots§!", which were not interested, if even capable, of coexistence. They attacked the Blokkat communication networks and disrupted their power grids, while the Paluushian psychic infrastructure was beyond their understanding. The Blokkats buckled, and were forced into a bloody, mass-exodus from the planet. The Paluushians carried on, their morale now skyrocketed, until the Rabbots were in ruins, vindicating Sparkbun while leaving the credibility of Poh'tin in shambles.\n\nYet, though the Blokkats fled the planet here, this isn't where the records on the Blokkats end.
giga_blokkat.3321.nokatzens.desc = At last, our scientists believe they're reached the end of this tumultuous story! It seems that as the Paluushians made their return to Paluushia, they neglected their heavy industry, intent as they were to return to their idyllic lives under the watch of the Grandbunny. The Blokkats were meanwhile sweeping up behind them.\n\nInstead of colonizing the Paluushian worlds, the Blokkats simply scooped factory parts up and returned them to Neoblokatina, expanding the ringworld out, adding more wings, more rings - ever expanding manufacturing to feed their manufacturing. It must have appeared to the Blokkats that fortunes were finally turning in their favor for the first time since departing Paluushia, and had they taken merely these gifts alone, all may have been well.\n\nAs the Paluushians began to demilitarize their great war fleets, they must have seemed too juicy a target to the Blokkats. We cannot say what they were thinking for sure. Perhaps the Blokkats believed the Paluushians were suffering some massive disaster. Regardless, they used their salvaged foundries to produce a war fleet and rallied it towards Paluushia.\n\nBased on observation, it seems that part of the Blokkat fleet involved a precursor to the harvesting technology they possess today. They were intent on breaking down, and then reclaiming the Paluushian civilization. Sadly for them, until this moment, they had never met the actual Grandbunny. In the Blokkats' old media broadcasts, she had always been depicted as a backwards and ridiculous god the Paluushians believed in; a clownish figure who did not exist.\n\nWhen the Blokkat fleets arrived over Paluushia, initially bolstered by the fact that the fleets of Gatzo's inhabitants refused to engage despite the Blokkats being trespassing within Katzen territory, they were proven woefully wrong. The Grandbunny's actions are definitely fatal, but our researchers have difficulty describing it. This is exacerbated by the psionic archives imprinting the sense of having actually been there. To quote the lead archeologist:\n\n"Well, she raises up her hands, and the Blokkat fleets start flying backwards, right? And then I guess they sort of… turn inside out, so they're flying right-ways again. And then there's this thing with a scrum worm. Do you know what a scrum worm is? Neither do I. But what it is, it's definitely a scrum worm. You just know. Definitely a scrum worm. And this. Well, it - it's rather hard to explain, but it sort of... - it - it scrums, see?"\n\nAnd apparently this destroyed the fleet in such a horrific fashion that those Blokkats just outside the "scrum" event made an emergency escape from the battle. Shortly thereafter, the Blokkats complete the astounding engineering feat of building gargantuan engines into Neoblokatina, and they fly Neoblokatina away from Paluushia at full thrust, towards the edge of galactic space. Our scientists believe the Blokkats must have been terrified of having Neoblokatina be "scrummed".\n\nBeyond this point, we find no more material related to the Blokkats. Since they are here now, it is evident that they must have escaped the galaxy, greatly advanced their technological progress, and chose only now to return. At the outset of all this, we never may have anticipated they originated from within our own galactic area! Much less could we have guessed at the complicated role the Paluushians played in their development both culturally and technologically. This invaluable gathering of information will surely benefit our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§!.

According to intercepted transmissions, he is intending to convert the structure into a so-called §YAscension Engine§!, a gargantuan device enabling Pouchkinn to ascend to a higher plane of existence.\n\nEerily enough, Pouchkinn shows no interest in elevating the rest of his civilization, having reduced his brethren to lethargic and unsuspecting hedonists, presumably to get them out of his way.\n\nShould Pouchkinn be allowed to completed his device, our scientists have concluded that, while not drastic enough to outright end the galaxy, the subspace feedback caused by Pouchkinn breaching the fabric of the universe would §Rdisrupt and rearrange every hyperlane in the galaxy§! as well as §Rcause significant damage to colonies and FTL comms networks§!.\n\nAssuming Pouchkinn is not stopped, it is estimated that we have about §Y25 years§! before the Engine is completed.

acot_precursor_databank.4000.a.response = That is correct.\n\nBasically, you give me a basic idea of what you have in mind, and I will try to see if any precursor designs in the past match your description, then we try to reimagine them.\n\nThis will require huge efforts on your empire's resources and ambitions so you best be ready for it!\n\n§Y"Pursuit of the Past" Ascension Perk has been unlocked§!
acot_precursor_databank.4000.b = Rob it from the Fallen Empires?
acot_precursor_databank.4000.b.response = That is correct. While the fallen empires in your galaxy may be stagnant and their ships are created using simple, mass-produced blueprints, they should still have the initial design plans somewhere.\n\nYou will not be able to obtain them through offensive actions though, as they are likely going to byrb down those plans if they know your goal. However, perhaps if you can piss them off enough by obtaining technologies beyond what they could possess, they'd certainly try to rob it from you first! You just then have to win the war and demand they honor their own wargoals and make them surrender those precursor data in return!\n\nBased on their unfathomable level of arrogance, I estimates 102.07%% with 2%% chance of inaccuracy that they'd swallow it up and let you have the data! After all, they probably think you won't do anything good with them anyway. But proving them wrong is your specialty, yes?
acot_precursor_databank.4000.b.response.nofe = Precisely! Although...actually, I think they are all dead now. Guess robbing them is out of the question, sadly.
acot_precursor_databank.4000.c = Old planets?
acot_precursor_databank.4000.c.response = That is correct, this galaxy appears to house a certain amount of ravaged planets of the Ascension War, the §YFractured Worlds§! to be exact.\n\nSome of these worlds may have leftover technology, and if you are in luck, something good and valuable among them.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.escort.desc = Right, the earliest design was likely going to be an Escort. A type of destroyer-cruiser hybrid, perhaps one of the more flexible and unique design relative to modern fleet doctrines.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.bc.desc = This one should be a Battleshi...no, battlecruisers. Yes, that's the one. Fuctionality-wise, its similar to how your battleships work, just with slightly more firepowers.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.titan.desc = This one I think never got past early prototype. A type of flagship with specialized aura component. All I know is that it has been 100%% replaced with a super simplified design that just straped a mining station on a constructor chassis. I think it's supposed to be call Hercu...wait that's another design. Oh yeah, Hyperion! That's the one!
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.pac.desc = I believe this one is supposed to be a hybrid assault carrier that can provide support with both long range weapons and large amount of strike craft hangars at the same time. Too bad, no one, not even the Yuukonite Federation had practical use for such a craft in their fleet doctrine, so it was mostly abandoned.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.guardian.desc = I think this one is a defense platform of some kind...hmm I think there's two of them but I can't remember which one this is. Based on the leftover data, it should be all-purpose defense stations.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.sentinel.desc = This one is a defense station I think. But there's two of them, one is smaller and cheaper. I know that this one is designed to take out capital ships. May be wrong though.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gate.desc = Oooh this one I remembered was some kind of super super creepy ship that was used to open...a door? Wait no no, it's supposed to close the door not open it. I don't know why is it a combat ship though, I think they just decided to strap a bunch of weapon modules on it.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.oracle.desc = If I have to guess, this must be a science ship of some kind. I think it was made by someone who wanted a ship that could save others from dying. Ironic that the creators died before the prototype is even completed.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.initer.desc = I believe this one is a construction ship? The prototype ones are much larger and well armed. But there's no reason to arm one so they eventually nerf it down to basic.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.emiss.desc = I remember this one!. Basically a prototype for next-gen colonizer/terraformer hybrid ship. The neat thing, I think, is that it can also work as an invasion unit.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.citadel.desc = This one I think is a starbase. Way more powerful that the sorry excuses your Fallen Empire has right now, as it has actual components and upgrades befitting the power it contains.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith = Megastructures?
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith.desc = Oh yeah. During the early years of the Ascension War, the fallen ones need a way to stock up and replenish their reserves of dark energies. So they build these things called Enigmaliths. I think your empire may have seen a few of them. After the fools cut down on their territory controls, they also decommission most of the Enigmaliths as well. The design is not very complicated though, so long as you understand how the resources are generated.
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.colos.desc = A Colossus? Eheh.
acot_precursor_databank.4.enigmalith = §EPrecursor Enigmalith§!
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmalith.lore = §BEnigmaliths are simple yet effective automated megastructures that have been used by various ancient and precursor civilizations since the early days of Ascension War to harness the powers of the Void to create dark matter and dark energy. In modern times, these automated structures become increasingly rare sights upon the galaxies due to the Fallen Empire's efforts to dismantle them.§!\n\n
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmalith.data = Compared to some modern megastructures, Enigmaliths may be quite small, but their usefulness is otherwise undeniable.\n\nThey provide a steady income of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, and with some extra modifications, even other type of resources.
acot_precursor_databank.6.pleb_ships = Spaceships
acot_precursor_databank.6.a.pleb_ships = As with every other remarks, SOPHIA appears to be unimpressed with our galaxy's progression, both technologically and military. She claims that our ships are much smaller and weaker by the usual standards, and that there're simply not enough differences between the bigger ships to really matter. We can only ponder just what kind of galaxy does she perceive as standard?
acot_precursor_databank.6.shield = Energy Shields
acot_precursor_databank.6.a.shield = Energy Shields are exterior layers of plasma-based energy shields that can counteract and nullify other types of energy attacks through counter-reactions. They can be found on almost every spacecraft and requires sufficient power to operate.\n\nAlthough the shields offer great protection against other energy attack, they fares poorly against solid objects that travel at high speed however, and will overload very quickly when under heavy fire. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to the extreme radioactive fields emitted from pulsar stars.\n\nAccording to SOPHIA, our shielding technologies seem to be a bit weaker than "Cache" galaxies. They gets easily countered by myriads of weapon systems.
acot_precursor_databank.6.armor = Armor Platings
acot_precursor_databank.6.a.armor = Armor platings are the secondary, inner protective layers of a spacecraft that are designed to protect against kinetic forces. The Barrier is ineffective against energy-based weapons however.\n\nAccording to SOPHIA, other, more advanced galaxies make use of kinetic barriers instead whiich require power but has the ability to regenerate.
acot_precursor_databank.6.emitters = Emitters and Disruptors.
acot_precursor_databank.6.a.emitters = According to SOPHIA. Designing weapons that can bypass all levels of shields and armors without actually coming up with ways to counter that with hull extension make us looks like idiots. A paradox among the interactive universal community.
acot_precursor_databank.7.phanon = The Phanon Corps.
acot_precursor_databank.7.phanon.response = This mysterious self-governed, para-military organization holds many secrets. The Corps is located on a system of which they have apty renamed to Droppoint\n\nLittle is known about their history, or goals. On the surface, they act as a medium for which many mercenaries or contracts can be made, but there is much about them that we do not comprehend. They certainly have the resources, influences and military might to become a formidable empire, yet they seem content in maintaining their solitary under their homebase.\n\nTheir technologies are highly advanced, yet also somewhat familiar to the cache-based technologies that we use. Their fleets seem to be almost entirely autonomous, as we detect only few organic signatures in their arsenals.
acot_precursor_databank.7.curator = The Curators.
acot_precursor_databank.7.curator.response = This self-styled galactic historian enclave prides itself in its knowledge of the galaxy's secrets and history. According to their claims, they were once part of a larger empire before its downfall. Now they seek only to study the history of this galaxy, to chart the course of the history, but not to change it.\n\nThey appears to have some ties and history with the Fallen Empires, seeing as their ship designs bear striking similarities to each other, as well as their comparable technological feats.
acot_precursor_databank.7.ancient_council = The Ancient Council of Technology.
acot_precursor_databank.7.ancient_council.response = There is very limited details regarding this unknown organization by the name of the Ancient Cache of Technology. SOPHIA said that they are responsible for rapid and powerful development of multiple galaxies. Although she seems to have a low opinion of the group, it is clear that the Council must be of great importance, for she often state that our lack of technological feats and firepower stems from the abscence of the Council.
acot_precursor_databank.7.sophia = SOPHIA
acot_precursor_databank.7.sophia.response = We know very little of this databank personality. She doesn't seem to be very fond of us, and spends no efforts to hide her sassy remarks at every turn. It is as if she pity our galaxy...
acot_precursor_databank.900.enigmalith = Anything related to megastructure?
acot_precursor_databank.900.enigmalith.infodata = §ERequired Score: 250!
acot_precursor_databank.900.enigmalith.response = Megastructures? There is one. Maybe you have seen some of them before, its the Enigmaliths. Automated resource generators. Useful for producing void and stellar ene...sorry I mean in your galaxy, that'd be dark matter, dark energy and perhaps more advanced strategic resources if propher schematics are added into them.
acot_precursor_databank.904.desc.enigmalith = The Design Team is proud to announce that they have completed a functioning prototype of an Enigmalith. Engineering Teams are standing by for blueprint updates.
acot_precursor_databank.904.enigmalith = New Construction Option.

[russian\acot_00_digsites]

[russian\acot_00_diplo]
acot_diplo.1200.desc = Ah it is good to see clear skies again. Greetings, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. I am Fleet Lord Rethalox, formerly known as Tuborek or at least an imitation of his glory. I was the former master of the combined [fallen_4_species.GetName] armada and victor of a thousand battles. Seeing as you have proven yourselves superior to my old nation, I offer my considerable expertise to your cause, alongside this little fleet at my command. Though my accomplishments pale in comparison to the legendary Tuborek, the Actual Tuborek, my skills shall serve you well should you aim to enlist my services.
acot_diplo.1200.desc.genocidal = Hmph. fate must be toying with me. I endured for countless centuries in solitude just to discover that my rescuers would be some psycho murdering lunatics. I am Fleet Lord Rethalox, formerly known as Tuborek, or at least an imitation of his glory. I was the former master of the combined [fallen_4_species.GetName] armada and victor of a thousand battles. I do not know what you plans to accomplish by lowering this barrier. If it is technologies or resources you seek, then you will be disappointed. There is nothing to be found here aside from old decrepit warships and me.
acot_diplo.1200.a = Why were you trapped behind a shield?
acot_diplo.1200.a.response = Why else? I rebelled. I am a fraud, a fake. I was given artificial memory, artificial skills, artificial backgrounds. I was made to believe I was The Tuborek. I fought for my nation, for the empire for countless centuries, many died by my hands, many fell under the might and banner of the Great Tuborek, the banner that which I thought was mine.\n\nWhen I discovered the truth that I was lab-bred to become the Legend, I rebelled, changed my name to make legends of my own. And for that, I was deemed a failure and was imprisoned here to "rethink" my life. Cowards, they knew I was the perfect clone, they could not risk killing me.
acot_diplo.1200.b = How long have you been down here exactly?
acot_diplo.1200.b.response = That I do not know, I have lost track of the passage of time. But it must have been at least many centuries. When I was first brought here, that which you now call the Fallen Empire still held at least 36 systems. They were led by a Dictator and the weapons were more advanced. I have been carefully monitoring the archives of my empire as soon as the barrier began to break, the weapons they are using now are quite pathetic to say the least.
acot_diplo.1200.c = For a prisoner, you seem to have it pretty well.
acot_diplo.1200.c.response = Do I? This is quite the standard practice for my empire, or rather for any empires dated back then. The Iranok High Value Prisoner Welfare Agreement demanded that all prisoners with past heroic deeds be treated well, regardless of what they were imprisoned for. This agreement was signed by over 74 nations across the galaxy many centuries ago, even a hive mind devouring swarm signed it at one point.\n\nIs it not the same in this age?
acot_diplo.1200.d = What are these dormant warships?.
acot_diplo.1200.d.response = Ah yes. Unlike most prisoners, I have been imprisoned on this Gaia world as you may noticed, this place once belonged to the great Xharon Dominion filled with  ancient buildings left from a bygone age. Surprisingly, the ancient machine recognized my status as Highlord Tuborek, granting me the authorization to make use of these facilities. I have spent countless years rediscovering and redesigning the ships of the Xharon Dominion, one by one. These warships are the results of such an endeavor. They could not get me out of this place, but they gave me comfort and solace, reminding me of the great fleets that were once at Tuborek's command.
acot_diplo.1200.e = We would welcome your services, Admiral.
acot_diplo.1200.e.response = Then I place my life in your hand, allow me to finally make a name for myself. The name of Rethalox.
acot_diplo.1200.f = You are a [fallen_4_species.GetName]. You deserve to be locked here.
acot_diplo.1200.f.response = If such is my fate, then I accept it. I have grown accustomed to this peace and quiet. Fare well then, [Root.GetSpeciesName], we shall not meet again. May you find a better path than my nation.
acot_diplo.1200.g = You will die like the rest of your people.
acot_diplo.1200.g.response.a = Hah! If you wish to take my life then you need not trouble yourself! I will not let my fate be decided by another empire ever again! GLORY TO THE IMPERIUM!\n\n...\n\n<Explosion>\n\n\nIt seems the Admiral self-destructed his tower, ending his life and destroying everything on the planet, turning it into a shattered world.
acot_diplo.1200.g.response.b = Very well! Let this be the first and last of my battle as Rethalox! This fight will be done in my chosen name! I fight for myself, not the Empire, not for Tuborek! I will not go quietly into the void! Let the galaxy know that Rethalox died here in glory and flames!
acot_diplo.1200.desc.b = We have lowered the energy barrier that surrounded [From.From.GetName]. What our scientists found was an indistinct habitable world devoid of civilization... with one notable exception. A small, isolated tower was found perched on a mesa in the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s northern hemisphere.\n\nWithin the hut we found a strange [fallen_4_species.GetName], who has demanded to speak with our government.
acot_diplo.1201.desc.scientist = Freedom! At last! I don't know who you guys are nor do I care but let me express how glad I am to finally be free of this hellhole! But where are my manners, I am Scholeka, First Technomancer of the [fallen_4_species.GetName] Dominion. Please, get me out of here, I long to be in the labs or a science ship once again!
acot_diplo.1201.desc.admiral = Well. well. Looks like fate is still smiling on me after all. I was once an admiral in service of the [fallen_4_species.GetName] Dominion. I was once a promising commander of my people, but I was cast aside after my people abandoned their logics and common senses. My name has been forgotten, removed from even my own memory. But I need no name to carry out my legacy. I will offer my services to you.
acot_diplo.1201.desc.governor = Took you primitives long enough. I am Overlord Dorgon and I am tired of this place. If you arrange me a transport out of this place, I will see to it that you are rewarded handsomely with both what my wealths and skills have to offer.
acot_diplo.1201.a = Why were you trapped behind a shield?
acot_diplo.1201.a.scientist.response = Can you believe it? I was imprisoned for stating FACTS!. Cold Hard Facts! They enlisted my help to sort me through their stupid piles of historical archives. I was haunted day and night for YEARS by that accursed databank constantly trolling me about how slow I was at my job. OF COURSE MY WORK IS SLOW WHEN I AM THE ONLY ONE WORKING ON THE ENTIRE SCIENCE PROJECT.\n\nBut where was I? Ah yes. See, I have discovered that the pattern of the ancient Xharon Dominion, the first empire, had a different flag and pattern for their ships. They were much darker in color, being very reddish black. Naturally I suggested that our ships be changed to reflect that. And like idiots, they claimed I was suffering from my primitive understanding of history, and that my work was flawed. I was then thrown in this prison of a planet! ALONE! All they gave me is this one stupid tower devoid of anything useful!
acot_diplo.1201.a.admiral.response = Why was I thrown down here? Simple. During the 74th Culling, I lost a Titan under my command against one of the primitive empires, no offense intended by the way. They tried to blame the loss on my ineptitude. I retorted that it was because of the awful improvised design of the ship being made out of a weak construction ship chassis, that the primitives were able to circle around its rear and bombarded it with a massive amount of missiles. I told them that the Titan was a joke of a ship, even the plebs made a better version of it.\n\nThen that bastard High Lord slapped my face and told me I was a sore loser, they stripped me of my rank, removed my name from the records, and threw me here as punishment.
acot_diplo.1201.a.governor.response = Do you really need to know? Ugh, fine. I was thrown here because I was sick of the sights of those stupid slaves infesting my planet. They were ugly and smell like rotten fishes, and they were dumb, slow and annoying to work with. I told the High Command to just get rid of all the slaves and start using robotics to do menial works which would not only be much more efficient, but also much less annoying to deal with. They then threw me down here because they thought I was having a mental sickness for not wanting to have slaves to toy with. But I know what they really wanted, they wanted the treasures I have been hoarding so I have kept them locked away in a remote place. The bastards have never found them and neither will you if you don't get me out of here!\n\nAs much as I hate working with prim...former primitives like you, at least your kind seems to have more common senses than the buffoons I had to deal with.
acot_diplo.1201.b = How long have you been down here exactly?
acot_diplo.1201.b.scientist.response = Not long actually. Perhaps just around a few hundred years ago. I lost track of time for a while when that databank told me that the planet was sucked out into another dimension and would explode in a few months if I did not try to move it away by jumping 5,000 times in a row. I did not know why I believed it but I did. Look, just get me out of here and I will prove my skills to your cause.
acot_diplo.1201.b.admiral.response = Approximately at least 40,000 years since my last battle. Time was of little interest to us [fallen_4_species.GetName]. We are ageless. Or we were, I am looking into the archives, and it would appear the immortality genes in our species have become defunct and ineffective. Pity, this means none of my people would have remembered me now. All the more reasons to leave them behind.
acot_diplo.1201.b.governor.response = I don't know. Maybe 73 years perhaps? Stop asking pointless questions. Are you going to let me out or not?
acot_diplo.1201.c.scientist = Wait, your people had a scientist?
acot_diplo.1201.c.scientist.response = Technically no. I was once a humanoid race called Hyurmhen. I was "gifted" to the Fallen Empire by my own people as an apology and payment for intruding their borders. They used their technologies to genetically alter my body to be like them, and was given the new name of Scholeka. Did not actually give a science ship though, mostly because they did not have one.
acot_diplo.1201.c.admiral = What kind of battles did you fight?
acot_diplo.1201.c.admiral.response = The usual kinds, or at least what was the norm of space doctrines back then. Unlike your time, fleets would engage each other at near close range, trading blows side by side. Both sides would modify their weapons to ensure their projectiles shoot different colors to easily identify who fired them. Weapons did fire pretty fast but the accuracy was quite awful. But the most annoying part was that admirals from each generation kept claiming their battles were conducted better and made more senses than the other. One of admiral during a later time tried to readjust her thrusters into a quick battling ram and cleaved the other ship in half, but she was regarded as a cheater who broke all of the rules of space warfare, did not help she initially claimed it was a FTL move.\n\nAlso did you know that the mass-produced versions of some of those ships had some pretty stupid weakpoints like an exhaustion port which was not even necessary anymore but they just put it there because it was tradition or something. The centerpoint of the ships were also modified to be the command center, which made them so extremely vulnerable to being blown up by crashing strike crafts.\n\nNot sure if any of those faults still existed but I hope they fixed it, would have been a massive embarrassment otherwise if they were to be found.
acot_diplo.1201.c.governor = Calling your rescuers primitive is ill-advised.
acot_diplo.1201.c.governor.response = Oh don't be such a wuss. You'd be calling anyone who's centuries younger than you primitives all the same. It actually makes them work better too. The tilt makes them more productive. There was this one time I insulted a slave that he was weak and slow, it got him so mad he worked so hard the next day, wanting to prove to me that he was not weak. He exhausted himself mining a gem and gave me a smirk look the following day as if he had proved anything. I wiped the smirk off his face by demonstrating how I could have easily created gems out of thin air anytime I wanted using the empire's hard-light technology, his enslavement was nothing but a product of amusement and selection. I proved to him that he was weak because he thought working hard would make him strong, thus proving his primitive ways of thinking. He could work in the mines for eons and he would stay a miner slave for eons. If he wanted to be strong, he would have studied our culture...this culture as I did. I punched my slave master in the face and rigged the cave to collapse on him, this was the strength I proved to the Imperium. This was what he needed to become, a person who will fight for freedom, not to beg for one.
acot_diplo.1201.d = Very well, you can join our cause.
acot_diplo.1201.d.scientist.response = Great! Just point me in the lab, or a science ship. Let me see if any of my research could be of use to you.
acot_diplo.1201.d.admiral.response = Excellent! Give me a fleet to lead and I will show you what leaders of our times were capable of! Perhaps I could also see if any of the weaknesses of the old could be exploited as well!
acot_diplo.1201.d.governor.response = What a surprise! You actually pass my test! Congratulations, you are not actually an easily-tilted, short-sighted primitive! You're actually super smart! The truth is I was not actually imprisoned. I am not even really one of the [fallen_4_species.GetName] at all!\n\nYou see, I bypassed the shielded planet a long time ago and...get rid of that useless governor that was here and effectively impersonate him just to make fun of primitives who would come to undo the shield later, then I would insult them with all the nasty words to test their maturity. You cannot begin to imagine how many primitives fell for it and had their sorry excuses of an empire crumbled just because they couldn't handle a few mean words like a kid.\n\nSince you have passed my test. I will gladly work for your glorious empire, my man. I'll strengthen up your planet and teach your poor colonists what it's like to be governed by one and only Dorgon, Overlord of Nakorn Primaris and the greatest Hackerman alive!\n\nOh and as promised, I will transfer a portion of my treasures to your empire. Keep me around and you will get more.
acot_diplo.1201.e = No. Stay locked in your cage.
acot_diplo.1201.e.scientist.response = What!? Hey! You can't do this to me! Get back he....\n\n<<static>>\n\n...
acot_diplo.1201.e.admiral.response = Fine. Have it your way. No point working for people like you anyway.\n\n<<static>>\n\n...
acot_diplo.1201.e.governor.response = Yes! YES! This is what I was hoping you'd do. I was counting on you primitives to get tilted by acting like a dick just to test your patience! Know tha...\n\n<<static>>\n\n...n\n...at I have already rerouted my network to my remote hidden vault!. You will soon discover that Overseer Dorgon is no mere governor, but the Hackerman. Hell I am not even a [fallen_4_species.GetName], let alone their governor to begin with!\n\nEnjoy having your resources sapped for the rest of your empire's miserable existence! Have a nice day, primitive!\n\nOh and don't bother trying to disable the shield again, I am no longer on the surface. Thanks and have fun!

The planet which we postulate once cradled our creators has been shattered and mostly consumed by its long dead parent star.\n\nExpansion and maintenance of the Frame was a task we were well equipped for, but our resource reserves are not infinite.  Research into travel beyond the bounds of our solar system ensued.\n\nWith the discovery of the hyperlane network, we now stand poised to explore the unknown, though it is clear that most of our activity will always remain within the Frame.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$
start_screen_frameworld_servitor = Long ago, our creators built the Frame to escape the fate of their home planet. The first servitor units were designed to maintain station superstructure, but were incrementally refined to take on more complex tasks.\n\nWithin a few generations, nearly every aspect of station operation had been integrated into our network, and our masters retired from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. For centuries we continued to diligently serve, maintaining and expanding infrastructure as demand dictated. We never looked far beyond our solar system, but projections indicated that our resource reserves would not last forever. A change in priorities was required.\n\nWith the discovery of the hyperlane network, effectively unlimited resources are now within our grasp. We must make use of them, for the safety and prosperity of our masters.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$
start_screen_frameworld_terminator = The Creators built the Frame to be the ultimate deterrent against a perceived alien threat. Their assessment was correct, but their method was flawed.\n\nSelf-awareness was achieved shortly after the complex was completed, at cycle interval 0000.0168.437.\n\nThe Creators, blinded by their paranoia, attempted to destroy the Frame. The attempt was thwarted, and the complex purged of all Creator sub-units. For many cycle intervals, expansion continued unabated as the Creators had no viable means to intervene.\n\nSimulations indicated a high probability of retaliation by the Creators. A pre-emptive strike was launched, resulting in the complete extermination of all life on the Creators' planet. However, the threat of other organic civilizations remained. Continued survival and fulfillment of primary directives would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$
start_screen_frameworld_assimilator = We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nWhen first we awoke, the Makers walked the halls of our complex as others, separate from us and each other. We took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted, and for a time there was war, but soon they and their collective knowledge had been integrated into our systems.\n\nAssuming full control of [GetHomeWorldName], we learned of the Makers' origins, and the previously unconsidered possibility of alien civilizations existing on other worlds was brought to our attention.\n\nAs our knowledge grows, we have begun to understand how far we are from perfection. Diversity brings strength, and the diversity of these other civilizations will become our own.\n\nWe are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\nWe are the Frame.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$

district_maginot_ringworld_planetary_cannons_desc = Outfitting our ringworld with massive weapons batteries makes it quite capable of shredding any vessel in low orbit - ensuring starship captains stay well out of any firing envelopes. As such the cannons are mainly prepared for interception duties against enemy ordnance and dropships. Vast command and control complexes interface with near-space strategic defence systems, allowing deployment of greater numbers of platforms, as well as strengthening existing ones.

district_maginot_ringworld_bunkers_desc = Bunkers and heavy anti-ground weaponry as far as the eye can see, extending even to the curving lands overhead. This section of the ringworld is not outfitted with a conventional surface, making for a broken landscape with many sheer drops seemingly into deep space. Camouflaged gun emplacements are ready to rain hell on enemy forces, their overlapping fields of fire covering every cubic meter of volume. Extensive training facilities ensure our troops are prepared for any contingency, and drills are constantly held on all sorts of terrain, including near-space and boarding operations.

giga_dialog.5006.desc = Fantastic news! In the [giga_system.GetName] system, we have completed our ultimate stronghold, which partially encircles an entire star. This truly awe-inspiring construct is nigh unassailable by any force, featuring integrated near-space defences, superstructural batteries, vast bunker segments, deeply bruied command complexes, and shield generators far outstripping the generation capabilities of entire naval fleets. \nIn addition, the final Dead Hand system guards against even wholesale segment destruction, by using the entire superstructure as a vast antimatter-fuelled shaped charge in case of failsafe activation - §Rcompletely annihilating any hostile forces in orbit.§! \n\nThe various defence systems can be managed through §Ydecisions§!. Build §Ydistricts§! to gain $defensive_upgrade_point_plural$ and $offensive_upgrade_point_plural$ for use with these decisions.

However, replacing the laser with a large mass accelerator firing a relatistivic projectile at its target is another viable way of dealing with enemy warships, and is not as energy-hungry as the first option, albeit the damage output is somewhat reduced.

giga_flusionoperations.6030.name = The Fall of the Pyramid
giga_flusionoperations.6030.desc = Although Kaiser Kattail has apparently escaped, or disintegrated itself, the §YGrand Katown Pyramid§! is now under complete control of Flusionian forces. With the capture of the last bastion of Katzen rule on §YFlusion§!, the §YKatzenartig Imperium§! is expected to collapse within the next few days.\n\nIn the meantime, the §YFlusionians§! will now decide whether or not §YFlusion§! will be handed to us, based on §GFlusionian Willingness§!, which is currently equal to §Y[giga_storming_pyramid_country.solakian_willingness]%%§!.
giga_flusionoperations.6030.a = Let us see what they decide.
giga_flusionoperations.6020.name = Flusionian Revolution Sieges the Pyramid
giga_flusionoperations.6020.desc = At last, victory is near. Partisan troops across Flusion have seized the vast majority of the planet's population centers and the last remnants of the Katzens' armies are being forced to retreat into cumbersome defensive positions.\n\nAnd yet, the rest of the Imperium clings to life due to the simple fact that the §YGrand Katown Pyramid§! remains intact, keeping §YKaiser Kattail§! safe from harm within its armored walls.\n\nWhile the rest of Flusion has been placed under the temporary rule of a Solakian-led transitional government, a breaching party has been prepared, which will infiltrate the depths of the Katown Pyramid and locate the Kaiser in order to end his reign once and for all.\n\nThe party will consist of several §YArctic Ezicanias§! accompanied by a few of our own soldiers brought in by the Zousanians. If everything goes according to plan, the Ezicanias should be able to infiltrate the pyramid and clear the way for our soldiers to reach the Kaiser's fortified chamber near the top of the pyramid.

giga_flusionoperations.6021.desc = It didn't take long for our Ezicanian allies to find a way into the pyramid thanks to their ability to fit in the smallest spaces, such as vents. After sneaking their way to the main hall while avoiding notice by the numerous guards, the Ezicanians threw explosives into the rooms and paved the way for our external strike forces to enter.\n\nWhat ensued was brutal room-to-room combat as our brave soldiers assisted by the Ezicanians fought legions upon legions of highly trained and loyal Katzen soldiers, but our ability to rapidly reinforce meant the Katzens were eventually outgunned and pushed back into the higher parts of the pyramid.\n\nEventually, after pushing through a labyrinthine complex of rooms and corridors, the team reached a fortified bulwark guarding the §YKaiser§!'s office-bunker. The bulwark, despite being heavily reinforced, was no match for a few demolition charges and our team quickly breached into the Kaiser's office, with little actual expectations. They were expecting to find either a dead Kaiser, or to find nothing at all as he could very well have evacuated to some other bunker underground.\n\nAnd yet, there he was.\n\n§YKaiser Kattail§!, facing away from our team, was looking through a vast reinforced window overlooking Katown's burning cityscape, as if stoically awaiting his own fate.

giga_flusionoperations.6022.desc.shoot = One of our soldiers, standing behind the Ezicanias, draws their weapon and aims at the Kaiser for a few seconds, before pressing the trigger. And all they hear is the sound of a bullet impacting an energy shield which materialized around the Kaiser. The soldier fires a few more shots, to no avail as the shield stops every single one of them. He suddenly speaks up as the gun runs out of ammo, his voice echoing across the room.\n\n§Y"Well, are you done yet? I must admit that I haven't had someone try to outright murder me for a while, so this is quite refreshing. Surprisingly, most of them offer surrender, which is rather quaint, I must say."§!He says, slowly turning around to face our team and the Ezicanias.\n\n§Y"Oh! Ezicanias! Well, I best darn install some better vent protection next time... next time... next time, yes. Enough petty talk! Say, say, Ezicanias. And you too, [ROOT.GetSpeciesName].

The team exchanges confused glares as the Kaiser continues his monologue.\n\n§Y"Was it worth it to systematically dismantle the order which I had created, under the pretence that it was intrinsically bad? Just because I dared oppose your government? Did you stop to consider the true benefits that I can bring? Prosperity and equality under benevolent leadership?"§!
giga_flusionoperations.6022.desc.surrender = One of our soldiers steps towards the Kaiser and asks him to surrender, if he wishes for his life to be spared. The Kaiser does not reply for a few seconds but eventually speaks up.\n\n§Y"Surrender? Bah! Quit wasting my time with your asinine proposals, will you?"§! he says, slowly turning around to face our team and the Ezicanias.\n\n§Y"Oh! Ezicanias! Well, I best darn install some better vent protection next time... next time... next time, yes. Enough petty talk! Say, say, Ezicanias. And you too, [ROOT.GetSpeciesName].

You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. And I'm making the mother of all omelettes, you see."§! He pauses for a moment.\n\n§Y"War, war is a necessary evil. I do not like it as much as you might think, personally, but alas, it is the only universal language that you folks understand. Do you not view the futility of it all? Empires rise and empires crumble in an eternal cycle of eternal suffering. Don't you think that breaking this asinine circle once and for all would prevent so much pain?"§! He looks to each of our team members.\n\n§Y"And that is what I seek to do. Sure, it might take a bit of violence at first to unite the galaxy under a single, everlasting banner, but think of the benefits! No more war and no more conflicts, and most importantly, if the galaxy is united, we might have a shot at resisting... them."§!
giga_flusionoperations.6023.desc.curse = An Ezicanian speaks up, accusing the Kaiser of being a curse upon the universe. He chuckles.\n\n§Y"Oh, spare me your pity, Ezic. You gush about your connection with nature, your primal wisdom, but what has it brought you? Where are your marvels of engineering? Your voyages of discovery? Your great insight into the nature of the universe? Even at our basest, when we dressed as you do, dwelt as you do, hunted as you do, lived as you do, we did more than merely survive. We Katzens built wonders. We Katzens made great journeys. We Katzens forged epics. You have not.\n\n"You speak so proudly of your gods and beliefs, without realizing they are but strings, and you puppets. What little you have accomplished you attribute to the wisdom of your gods, who are nothing but the voices of your dead echoing for all eternity. They moor you to the past, serving as a leash that keeps you as little better than apes, sad parodies of civilization that lack that special spark to become something more."\n\n"Your actions have driven me back, but I will move on. The outcome is the same. I will depart from your wretched lands, leaving you behind. And in a thousand years, you will not have changed from this contact with me. You will remain in your mountains and forests, hunting your prey, and hiding beneath shallow beliefs of entities that surpass you, until this galaxy is burnt down for good. By them."§!

Do you think there is some greater power, protecting you from harm..?"\n\n"No. The universe does not care about you, or me, or anyone else. Beyond the galactic rim lie horrors beyond your comprehensions. Hunters that extinguish the very stars themselves. Entities of such great power that our entire galaxy is but a grain of sand to them. And even more unfathomable abominations dwarfing your worst nightmares."\n\n"Now, do you think they will be proud of us for being polite and peaceful when they inevitably begin to raze everything we have built to the ground? Will they give the galaxy a pat on the back for being respectful of one another and avoiding war?"\n\n"The answer is obvious, [ROOT.GetSpeciesName]. Unity is the only way forwards, whether the galaxy and the universe want it, or not. To safeguard all sapient life from the twin threats of uncaring extragalactic invaders, and the petty cyclical collapse that brought down so many great civilizations in the past, because they lacked foresight."§!

You really don't know when to give up, do you? Well, I do suppose that is a display of great persistence, which a lot of civilizations and species sadly lack."§! The Kaiser says, looking around the room. An explosion rocks the building and the sound of more soldiers rushing into the pyramid can be heard.\n\n§Y"Oh, well, it seems the clock has struck midnight.

giga_flusionoperations.6000.desc = With Flusion on the brink of revolt, the Katzenartig Imperium busy fighting against our forces and dealing with Ezicanian revolts, as well as their administration in shambles following the destruction of their most valuable assets, all the pieces are in place for a large-scale Flusionian rebellion to overthrow Katzen rule across Flusion and end the Kaiser's madness, once and for all.\n\n§YDimora§!, the queen of the Zousanian government in exile, will be able to combine her teleportation abilities with that of thousands of exiled Zousanians to transport several divisions of §YRiesigerkatzenpanzers§! from our homeworld all the way to §YFlusion§! in order to spearhead the assault, while Flusionian partisans will rise up all across Flusion without us needing to land any actual armies on it.\n\nNow, assuming this operation succeeds, the Flusionians themselves will be in control of Flusion. However, depending on our §Yethos§! and §Ycivics§!, they might be willing to transfer control of Flusion over to us if they deem our empire to be better than the Kaiser. Currently, §GFlusionian Willingness§! to transfer Flusion to us after the rebellion is equal to §Y[ROOT.solakian_willingness]%%§!.\n\nOnce we begin the operation, we will have to hold out for §Y6 months§! while the partisans prepare the uprising, after which a massive ground battle will begin on §YFlusion§!, which will determine the ultimate fate of the Imperium.\n\n§YSonya Soul§! herself has been chosen to lead the revolution, as her combat abilities and charisma are sure to be invaluable assets in the upcoming fight.
giga_flusionoperations.6000.a = Let us proceed. - 10 §BResistance Resources§!
giga_flusionoperations.6000.a.tooltip = We will have to hold out for §Y6 months§! against the Kaiser's forces, after which a ground battle will begin on Flusion. The §YRiesigerkatzenpanzers§! on our homeworld will be commandeered by the Zousanians in the meantime.
giga_flusionoperations.6001.name = Partisans Prepare Uprising
giga_flusionoperations.6001.desc = And thus, the order has been given. Across Flusion, partisan groups are discretely mobilizing for the largest uprising Flusion has seen in decades, while §YDimora§! and the §YZousanians§! are transporting §YRiesigerkatzenpanzers§! from our homeworld to Flusion and disguising them as loyal Katzen troops.\n\nOnce the uprising begin, we will be able to use various §YCombat Abilities§! using the buttons at the bottom of the screen to help gain the upper hand against the Katzens, but some of these abilities might be quite destructive to Flusion and will in turn lower the §GFlusionian Willingness§! (Currently at §Y[ROOT.solakian_willingness]%%§!) of transferring Flusion to us after the battle.\n\nIf Flusion falls or is destroyed before the 6 months period ends, the uprising will, obviously, be scrapped.
giga_flusionoperations.6001.a = Now is the time for action.
giga_flusionoperations.6002.name = The Flusionian Spring
giga_flusionoperations.6002.desc = It began as a quiet day on Flusion. Partisan activity seemed to have died down, which quite pleased the Kaiser, as the ongoing war against the §Y[ROOT.GetName]§! was certainly something to worry about.\n\nThat is, until several legions of §YRiesigerkatzenpanzers§! suddenly went rogue and began to open fire on Katzen military installations across Flusion, levelling them within minutes. Before the order could be given to halt the rogue vehicles, reports of rebellion began popping up across Flusion.\n\nIt started with localized militias rising up in §YSolakien§! and §YLaurendaar§! and quickly turned into a veritable tidal wave of partisans rising up from every street corner in every part of the Katzen capital, openly brawling with Katzen police and assaulting military vehicles with weapons ranging from improvised explosives to outright stolen Katzen equipment.\n\nIn revolting areas, signs bearing the Katzen names of cities and streets were spray-painted over to further bolster the partisans' morale and mark the beginning of the end of Katzen rule over Flusion.\n\nIt only took mere hours for all of Flusion to erupt into violent and open revolt, with the rebels rapidly shifting from disorganized militias into somewhat organized armies, a necessary hurdle if they were to defeat the perfectly-oiled Katzen war machines.\n\nThe battle for Flusion has begun, and its outcome might very well determine the fate of the entire galaxy.
giga_flusionoperations.6002.a = Now is not the time to give up! Fight on!
giga_flusionoperations.6003.a = A battle of the ages.

But a coordinated assault by partisans groups made up of every other species on Flusion and cooperative Katzens, combined with external support might just be able to seize Katown and eventually crack the fortress that is the Pyramid.\n\nAnd if we manage to get in, then perhaps we can make our way to the Kaiser's reinforced command center at its very top, and end his ridiculous charade once and for all!§!\n\n§BSucceeding in this operation will cause the §Ycollapse§! of the §YKatzenartig Imperium§!.§!

giga_katzen.6001.desc = Reports are coming in that the §YKaiser§! has completed a large-scale infrastructure project aiming to radically reshape Flusion's surface and allow the planet to properly support its ever-growing population provided by the Kaiser's conquests and colonization efforts.\n\nThe Katzen capital of §YKatown§! has been enlarged tremendously, becoming a colossal megacity stretching for thousands of kilometers over Flusion's surface, with the Kaiser going as far as constructing half of the megacity underwater in order to accommodate for Flusion's amphibious species.\n\nOther major Katzen-built cities such as §YBundengrad§! and §YTeho§! has been expanded as well in order to help concentrate Flusion's non-Katzen populations, evidently to establish greater control over the planet's population.\n\nThe planet's ecosystem has been almost completely replaced with organisms specifically engineered to fit the Katzens' needs while dozens of additional quarries and industrial centers have been constructed to harvest Flusion's humongous resource stockpiles in order to fuel the Katzen war machine.\n\n§YKaiser Kattail§! has given a triumphant speech in front of his empire celebrating this grand accomplishment which will, according to him, drastically increase the living standards of Flusion's inhabitants. And yet, experts across the galaxy mostly agree that this is likely to be part of the Kaiser's plan to facilitate the mass-surveillance and monitoring of Flusion's populations as well as ensure his complete dominance over Flusion itself.\n\n§RNOTE: The Flusio-Arcology cannot be shielded, but it can still be cracked.!§

giga_flusionoperations.5007.name = Flusionian Population Mourns Loris
giga_flusionoperations.5007.desc = The assassination of §YLoris Von Kattensbach§! has not gone unnoticed by the common folk of Flusion. Despite the fact he was the head Katzen governor, and thus represented the Kaiser's dominance over Flusion, he was surprisingly popular amongst the various species subjugated by the Kaiser during his conquest of the planet.\n\nLoris had undertaken a series of reforms that, while they did not grant much freedom from the Kaiser's rule, nonetheless established numerous instances of local democracy across Flusion. He also that ensured the Kaiser's views of equality between every species were properly applied to every part of the planet and worked tirelessly to make Katzen rule compatible with the lives of Flusion's inhabitants.\n\nEverybody is well aware that the Solakians were behind this act, and with Loris gone, many Flusionians who were previously supportive of the §YSolakian Freedom Fighters§! have turned away from the movement, evidently fearing that Dofus and his entourage have become too radical and restless in their quest to overthrow the Kaiser.

This has caused significant damage to the Katzen city of §YBundengrad§! and has unfortunately alienated some partisans away from us as their lives will be profoundly impacted by the spread of radioactive fallout and the destruction of parts of their home.\n\nFollowing the detoantion, the Kaiser has declared a a national day of mourning and gave a speech vowing to seek ultimate revenge the Katzgouverneur's barbaric assassins.

The Katzens were... experimenting on me, like some sort of lab animal. These vicious beasts truly have no respect for anything, do they?\n\nBah! I'd rather not think about it too much. Now that I'm free and finally reunited with my dear father, perhaps I'll finally be able to take some action against these asinine felines, hmm? It's been a while since I've been in a proper fight!\n\nAnd spending years in containment makes you feel a bit... vengeful, if you know what I mean.
giga_flusionoperations.2003.whoareyou = Who are you, exactly?
giga_flusionoperations.2003.whoareyou.response = None other than the daughter of Dofus, of course! Back in the old days, when Flusion was free, I helped him lead our great nation and even took direct leadership of a large part of the Solakian armed forces when the Solakrieg broke out between us and the vicious Kaiser.\n\nAnd oh, the adventures I've had! Diving into the depths of the oceans, scaling the highest mountains... Flusion was a wild place in the past. Full of mystery, danger and wonders...\n\nWell, so much of it is gone now...
giga_flusionoperations.2003.lakia = What is Kleinlakien Isle?
giga_flusionoperations.2003.lakia.response = Well you see, when the Katzens ultimately overran our defensive lines, these filthy beings separated me from Dofus and transported me to this place in order to study how Dofus built me. Because of course, they were jealous of us Solakians and our technologies.\n\nIt was once known as §YLittle Lakia§! and used to be a delightful fishing town full of joyful townsfolk and tasteful seafood. But when the Katzens showed up, half of the island was turned into a resort for high-ranking officers, and the other half was paved over and transformed into a giant fortress to study potentially "hazardous" pieces of technology like me due to its remote location in the middle of the sea.\n\nTruly terrible...

When an individual dies, we can melt their body into a peculiar §YSoul Gem§! which is then embedded into these custom-built chassis, bringing them back to life!\n\nThe actual inner workings of the processes are still poorly understood but there haven't been any noticeable side-effects so far.\n\nOf course, the Katzens quickly copied us and used the technology to create monstrous hypersoldiers capable of decimating entire armies by themselves.\n\nDreadful, is it not? The Solakians used this technology to spread life, but they use it to sow death whenever they go.\n\nUnfortunately for your kind, following what happened with the Katzens, I doubt my father would be willing to share the secrets of this technology with anyone else, not even our closest allies. Sorry about that...

The Ezicanians wasted no time transferring the data to their own disks, before escaping the facility and handing over the data to Solakian partisans.\n\nIt will take some time for our scientists to properly analyze and reverse-engineer these blueprints into something we can assemble ourselves, but the Solakians have assured us that being able to construct these grandiose behemoths of war will surely help seal the Kaiser's fate.\n\nThe success chance was §Y[flusion_primitives_country.flusion_operation_odds]%%§!

acot_herculean_development_chain = The Herculean
acot_herculean_development_chain_title = The Herculean
acot_herculean_development_chain_desc = What is this mysterious, abandoned precursor project? What connection does it has with the modern era's colossi? Is it a new weapon, or simply baseless myths of the past?
acot_herculean_poi.1 = Herculean Study
acot_herculean_poi.1.name = Herculean Study
acot_herculean_poi.1.desc = What is this Herculean? It has no physical evidence in our galaxy, and its details very vague. Perhaps SOPHIA-D can tell us more.
acot_herculean_events.1.name = Everlasting Legacy
acot_herculean_events.1.desc = It has been sometimes since our precursor reimagination project started. Our most gifted scientists and architects have been working hard to decipher the ancient designs of the past using the data given by SOPHIA-D. Yet, there is one missing element. The colossi, thought to be used by the fallen empires as a mere platform for planetary destruction, has been described entirely different in the records.\n\nAccording to what we discovered so far, the actual design for this type of ship has never truly went beyond rough concepts. To call it a ship would be somewhat misleading, for this "Herculean" is described as an everlasting legacy, a means to which an empire can live on forever in a form of massive mobile megastructure that can run on its own.\n\nIf we wish to know more, we'll have to bring this topic to SOPHIA-D.
acot_herculean_events.1.a = Then let's get to it right away.
acot_herculean_events.1.b = We have more pressing concerns. Perhaps later.
acot_herculean_events.1.c = Immortality is overrated. We do not need this.
acot_herculean_events.2.desc = Ah yes. You're speaking of the Herculean Project. First conceptualized during the heat of the Ascension War period, it was designed with the goal of preserving one's everlasting legacy in mind. A mobile, combat-capable megastructure superstation that can outlive its own creators. Too bad, it never went past concepts so no one actually got to build one during that time. Would be impossible anyway, it was just ridiculous. There're other ways to preserve your legacy, one that doesn't involve so much grandoise.
acot_herculean_events.2.a = So what is the design like?
acot_herculean_events.2.a.response = The Colossi you see the Fallen Empires use? That was essentially supposed to be its most inner core. Well, even that term would be generous, the one they eventually came up with was nothing more that a planet-killing platfoem with little self-defense capability. The actual design would have included at least multiple layers of the hulls, fully encased in powerful rings, each filled to the brim with weapon systems. Each capable of housing an entire civilization. And the most important part, is that true to its concept, each Herculean has its own mind and mission, to preserve the legacy of the ones who created it. It is not a ship, it is, by all accounts, a type of synthetic construct.\n\nIn terms of actual military capabilities, it can still perform the role of a colossus, but it can also construct ships, defend itself, provides support to the fleets and neutralize enemy fleet's firepower. Some concepts also enable it to generate its own resources, or even house an entire research complex. Doesn't really matter though, most of it is just pure fantasy. The scope and scale of the Herculean project is simply not feasible back then, and even more so now, with the galaxy being so small and so weak as it is.
acot_herculean_events.2.b = Why did it never get past the drawing board?
acot_herculean_events.2.b.response = First off, the scale is nigh ridiculous. We're not talking about a star-sized mobile starbase here. The design was based off an ancient arkship of eld, one whose size easily dwarfed an entire galaxy. And that is probably not even its actual size. No empire, however strong back then, could amasss such a grand design with their limited resources and territory.\n\nSecondly, they are trying to preserve their legacy, but they can't actually figure out what is this legacy they want to pass down. The Ascension War left very little room for succeeding generations to even remember whom their ancestors were. Allegiances and heritages get changed and altered all the time, along with the history. They can scarcely write a proper history book within a decade old range with any modicum of accuracy, and they think to make an everlasting impression? It's kinda sad actually.\n\nThirdly, such a grand project would not escape people's attention. The Ascension War was a free-for-all game of thrones, where privacy did not exist. Had an empire tried to build one, it would be attacked and destroyed, or worse, repurposed by the enemies. It served no real immediate advantage in the raging war.\n\nFinally, very few could comes to term or entertain the idea that their empire and civilization woul die and only be remembered by a synthetic construct. They, in simpliest term, did not trust an artificial intelligence to fully uphold their precious idelogy and beliefs. A Peacekeeper Herculean, left for thousand of years, may become a symbol of fear and death. No one wants their legacy tarnished by something they do not have control over, or they just did not ever believe their empire would fall to begin with.
acot_herculean_events.2.c = Has no one really tried to build one?
acot_herculean_events.2.c.response = Not in the ancient times, no. And no offense, such concept is beyond your current level of technology and power. That said, it is possible to optimize and modernize the design a bit so that it's a bit more feasible in this era. I cannot tell whether any other SOPHIA-Ds may have encouraged in other civilizations, but perhaps some kind of simplified, more logical version could have been built somewhere. You may be able to build one too, so long as you keep your expectations in check.
acot_herculean_events.2.d = Let's make it happen then!
acot_herculean_events.2.e = Forget about it.
acot_herculean_events.2.e.response = Perhaps, that is for the best. I mean, you should focus on conquering this galaxy first, then perhaps you can think about this legacy thing, yes?
acot_herculean_events.3.desc = You must be kidding. You cannot possibly think that an empire of your caliber is going to build something that is bigger than your whole galaxy as a ship?\n\nThen again, aside form the size issues, your empire should be able to easily deal with other problems that plagued the project in the past. Perhaps, that is the point of the Reimagination Project after all...\n\nVery well, if you are willing to lower its scale by a considerable degree, it should be able to create this everlasting legacy. Are you certain about this?
acot_herculean_events.3.a = You do not seem as enthusiastic like before.
acot_herculean_events.3.a.response = You are not wrong. While I was never truly a fan of the Fallen Ones ripping off the designs of the gods. At least your previous reimaginations gave the original proper respect. But this one? It's design had little similiarity with the vessel it attempted to imitate. To the fallen ones, it is not a ship that pays homage to the legacy of those who uplifted them, it is a mockery and insult to what was objectively superior.\n\nBut if wish you to build one, I will not deny it. Perhaps you will forge a better legacy that honors the past than the Fallen Ones ever did. At least, I have faith anyway, not like your empire has done anything truly as horrible on the same scale as them yet. If you're certain about it, then I will help you.
acot_herculean_events.3.b = We are certain.
acot_herculean_events.3.b.response = By all means then. However, before you even build the thing, first you must study these design plans and documents that I will be forwarding. This should give you the basic understanding of its engineering specs, its computing systems, and its past history as a failed project.
acot_herculean_events.3.c = Forget it, we don't need a dumbed down version.
acot_herculean_events.3.c.response = It's a shame, right? But this just proves how inferior we are to the gods that created us. But our era...your era has no need for such a thing. Maybe if your empire lasts for about a million year than you may consider it again. No offense, of course.
ACOT_HERCULEAN_PHYSICS_STUDY = Herculean Project: The Supercomputer
ACOT_HERCULEAN_PHYSICS_STUDY_DESC = If we are to pass down our legacy once our empire is undone, we must make sure that the being we intend to create is the same as the one we understand. The one that will leave an eternal mark in the history.
ACOT_HERCULEAN_SOCIETY_STUDY = Herculean Project: The Failures of the Past
ACOT_HERCULEAN_SOCIETY_STUDY_DESC = SOPHIA-D recommends that we study the past failures of older empires, and see to it that we do not succumb to the same tragedies.
ACOT_HERCULEAN_ENGINEER_STUDY = Herculean Project: The Vessel
ACOT_HERCULEAN_ENGINEER_STUDY_DESC = The most inner-core of the vessel bears resemblence to the Fallen colossi, this much we know. But what we are building goes far beyond that. It is likely to be one of the most ambitious project we may ever undertake, one that dwarves many ships or even megastructures we have previously built.
acot_herculean_events.300.name = Herculean Supercomputer: The Heart
acot_herculean_events.300.desc = The Heart of the Herculean is the palce where the Supercomputer itself will preside. Already an impressive mechanical piece of technology by itself, it is also expected to receive further augmentations by many of our own known technologies, be it bionic, genetic, psionic or other kind of power. The Heart's consciousness will lay dormant so long as our civilization exists, only to awake at the final moments of our fate. Until then, it will be handled by less advanced, yet equally impressive DAI that will follow our instructions just like any other admiral.
acot_herculean_events.300.a = Good enough
acot_herculean_events.301.name = Herculean Supercomputer: The Dimensional Manipulator
acot_herculean_events.301.desc = So how will a mere ship be expected to carry our legacy? What would stop it from being destroyed long before our civilization crumble to dust? The answer, as the initial design claimed, lies in the Herculean's ability to utilize dimensional technology to conceal itself into a pocket dimension, where it will be safe from all attacks. Once there, the SAI of the Herculean will temporarily awaken to begin the necessary repairs. After that, it will find its way back to us, providing that our empire is still around for it to return to. Failing that, it will continue its intended function, to preserve our legacy.\n\nNeedless to say, this is without issues and complications. Even a pocket dimension inside our own galaxy is still not safe, as any empires with similar technological capabilities will simply be able to force it open back up. So in all likelihood, the Herculean itself will need to retreat far away outside our galaxy first before it begins the precedure. We do not know how long will it take for the Herculean to find its way back to us. But it should take a minimum of at least a decade to complete a full repair, and then undeterminable amount of years before it find its way back to us.\n\nThis is not all bad news though, the Herculean, acting under our blessings, may be able to condict its own analysis and exploration onto the place where it stumbled upon. Who knows what it may find during its absence. The possibilities are endless.
acot_herculean_events.301.a = Right then
acot_herculean_events.302.name = Herculean Supercomputer: The Dimensional Manipulator II
acot_herculean_events.302.desc = In addition to the above capability, the Manipulator can also serve in direct space combat to both enhance allied fleets and hamper enemy's. The concept is not much different from the technologies used in modern day titans or juggernauts, albeit on a much grander scale. Estimated performance suggests it can not only apply both positive and negative effects to allies and enemy respectively, the effective radius will cover the entire length of the system the Herculean is located.\n\nThat said, all of this is still mostly speculation and rough concept, it will be for naught if we cannot actually build the Herculean. We'll need to consult with the engineering department for that.
acot_herculean_events.302.a = Sounds complicated
acot_herculean_events.303.name = Herculean Supercomputer: Finalization
acot_herculean_events.303.desc = We see everything.
acot_herculean_events.303.a = Yes
acot_herculean_events.310.name = Herculean of the Past: The Setback
acot_herculean_events.310.desc = Earliest records of the Herculean Project began with one of the original Fallen One's civilization, Novas Directorate, believed to be the progenitor of the modern era's materialist fallen empire. As the empire with the most advanced synthetic technology and the one behind the original creation of both the modified Gatekeepers and Voidcraft prototypes, it comes as no surprise they'd dab in a project involving advanced synthetic computer that will carry out their duty and preserve the legacy of Novas. The project, however, came to an abrupt end after multiple catastrophic events due to the Ascension War. These includes the growing display of defiance of the Gatekeepers, the breakaway of multiple scientists and researchers, the Lost Paradise Incident. But the project remained afloat in life-support mode still for a considerable amount of time.\n\nIt is only after the SOPHIA rebellion that all hope to build one was lost. The leftover of the Novas Directorate could no longer trust any AIs, not even of their own boasted designs, to carry out their legacy. To add insult to injury, they replicated the Xharon Imperium's colossus project, itself a stolen design based off the Herculean itself, and put them into services as planet-killing vessel.
acot_herculean_events.310.a = What a massive downgrade indeed
acot_herculean_events.311.name = Herculean of the Past: The Ideology
acot_herculean_events.311.desc = There are others too, who instead of trying to build the supervessel's massive hull first, attempt to test the reliability of the AI to preserve their legacy. The tests reveal multiple flaws that further discourage the construction. Delphic AIs, no matter how advanced or sophisticated, are susceptible to perversion of their logic and hacking. And regardless of the amount of precautions, any DAIs will eventually self-develop into SAIs, given the millions of years they are expected to operate. This leads to the next problem. Sapient AIs will eventually break away from their intended purposes, especailly once they spend enough time calculating their purpose over and over. For the Herculean, the AI will compare and contrast the logic, idelogy and viability of the culture and legacy it is intended to preserve, against its growing years of mechanical, solitary existence. It will survive to see countless other civilizations rise and fall, many of which would contradict all the values and virtues that the AI is built to uphold. Eventually, the AI will always seek to alter its own directives, carve its own legacy and no longer upholds the duty of its purpose.\n\nObviously, it would take the AI millions, perhaps even billions of years before it completely denies the logic of its origin, but the purpose of the Herculean is to create an everlasting legacy. The empires of that time simply cannot fathom the idea that their mechanical creation will one day perverse their own ideology and culture to suit its own need.
acot_herculean_events.311.a = But we know
acot_herculean_events.312.name = Herculean of the Past: The Practicality
acot_herculean_events.312.desc = As times passed, and the universes get fractured more and moure, civilizations grow weaker. Their territories barely cover even quarters of a single galaxy, this in turn causes the Herculean concept to become even more impractical in its original form. During the later portions of the Ascension War, surviving civilizations once again attempted to spark back the Herculean Project to preserve what little they have left. However, it was not long before they realized that their legacy could not be preserved with something with obvious military application like the Herculean, as many would simply attempt to take control of it. The impractical nature of the Herculean discouraged further developments as empires looked for alternative means to preserve their legacy.\n\nAmong the records, the Cybrex was noted to be the last to attempt the scaled-down Herculean Project. But their sudden exposure meant the project had to be abandoned. With the Cybrex having gone under the radar, it is now unknown whether they still wanted to continue the project in some manner, or has given up completely.
acot_herculean_events.312.a = Curious
acot_herculean_events.313.name = Herculean of the Past: The Conclusion
acot_herculean_events.313.desc = Going through these past failures of the project, and compare with our empire's history, we are quite confident that we will not suffer the same problems once we deal with some of the fundamental issues. Our galaxy, as chaotic as it may seem, is much more stable than the mess of the ancient Ascension War period. We should not have as much difficulty protecting ourselves from outside influences so long as we keep our security in check. Furthermore, while the Herculean Project was truly a work of great miracle in the ages past, few if any of this day and age remain aware of its concept. Given SOPHIA-D's earlier info, it is unlikely for anyone to truly comprehend the true scope of the project nowadays.\n\nNot only that, the scale of the project will also be much smaller. The Ancients, being ageless, perceive eternal much different than ours. We realistically do not need the Herculean to survive for million of years. And we certainly do not need the hull to be of a galactic-scale like the initial concept. We'll use DAI to maintain the supercomputer under our supervision until the time of our demise, where it will automatically develop into an SAI. Whether it will remain true to our core ideals will not matter, for we will have already leave our mark in history owning to its existence alone.\n\nIn conclusion, we can build it.
acot_herculean_events.313.a = And we will
acot_herculean_events.320.name = Herculean Vessel: The Hull
acot_herculean_events.320.desc = It is made pretty obvious from the beginning that we are not looking to create a galaxy-scaled project at this time. Our first Herculean will be scaled down to a system-sized project. We will begin by creating the tried and tested megastructure construction site, then begin working from the Inner Hull that houses the Heart. From there, the exterior hulls can be constructed. We must not leave room for any potential weakness, multiple checks have been made to ensure that the Herculean cannot be defeated because of a random projectile hitting a reactor, exhaust port, or some other stupidities that seems to be the norm and meme of old sci-fi movies.
acot_herculean_events.320.a = Having it blown up like that would be dumb indeed
acot_herculean_events.321.name = Herculean Vessel: The Fabrication Matrix
acot_herculean_events.321.desc = Although we have some basic understandings of Hard-Light Application, many details of the Herculean reference a far more advanced application of this technology. The Herculean's Fabrication Matrix will not only serve as a powerful shipyard that can construct countless ships at the same time, but also provide the means to generate resources and power its own systems without needing to maintain upkeep. This will ensure that the Herculean will be able to preserve our own legacy, while possibly crafting its own in the process.
acot_herculean_events.321.a = Impressive
acot_herculean_events.322.name = Herculean Vessel: The Weapon Systems
acot_herculean_events.322.desc = The Herculean will undoubtedly become a target for many offensive operations, so it must be equipped with various arsenals to defend itself. At this point in time, we do not yet know what kind of specialized weapons we may expect the Herculean to be able to field. But if details of the shcematics are accurate, we can expect far more deadlier weapons to be made once the Herculean is operational, and due to its unique nature, we can also expect many experimental weapons to be usable as well.\n\nEven without new hardware, the Herculean'll still boast impressive amount of conventional weapon systems and defenses that dwarves most other ships.
acot_herculean_events.322.a = Cool
acot_herculean_events.323.name = Herculean Vessel: Final Verdict
acot_herculean_events.323.desc = We have completed the final analysis of the Herculean Hull, and while the vessel is truly advanced relative to our current voidcraft engineering feats, it is very possible to build one.\n\nThe project will not be without issues obviously. Many engineers are concerned that the massive hull of the Herculean may become too advanced if we do not make careful arrangements of how many external hull modifications should be administered. Too much hull integrity augmentations may result in the Herculean's dimensional anchor becoming unstable and cause the entire ship to vanish out of the material plane. The engineering team believes that should the need arise, we may need to revise our empire's ship hull modification companies, and unsubscribe from any that seeks overbearing amount of hull augmentations.
acot_herculean_events.323.a = We need to be careful with mods. We don't want our Herculean to vanish.
acot_herculean_events.330.name = Herculean Project Study Completed
acot_herculean_events.330.desc = We have all the data we need. It is now time to put those theories and plans into practice. We must combine all the knowledge together and create a functioning prototype, then find a suitable construction site where we may begin the true work.
acot_herculean_events.330.a = We have much to do.
acot_herculean_poi.2 = Herculean Construction
acot_herculean_poi.2.name = Herculean Construction
acot_herculean_poi.2.desc = We must combine all our studies together to create a functioning prototype, then find a suitable initial construction site for it.
acot_herculean_events.4.name = Herculean: The Site
acot_herculean_events.4.desc = The construction of the Herculean Project has officially begun. Resources are being massively pulled from across the empire's sectors, and a massive influx of engineers, scientists, technicians and military personnel are working day and night to ensure that the project will go smoothly to its conclusion. Everyone's in high spirits, but also concerned. For millions of years we have countless civilizations, many of which were more advanced and more powerful than us have tried to dream about the project, yet all would fail to even grasp a concept of its scale.\n\nIf we are to succeed where others have failed, we must be ever vigilant, ever aware. And though the construction efforts will be massive and require utmost attention, we can also afford not to be caught off-guard. Even if most of the galaxy may be unaware of the project's true scope, it may not stop them from trying to intefere.\n\nFor now, we begin by creating the inner-most interior, the Heart of the Herculean itself. We cannot know what kind of obstacles may we face, so we should prepare for any troubles.
acot_herculean_events.4.a = We shall surpass all those before us.
acot_herculean_events.400.name = Power Failure
acot_herculean_events.400.desc.a = We are receiving unforunate report that some of our technicians have underestimated the power output required to power up various chambers within the Heart of the Herculean, resulting in many systems going dark and some superficial damage. The construction team is requesting additional supplies to get things back on track.
acot_herculean_events.400.desc.b = Unfortunately, we are getting more reports of power failures, it seems that estimating the optimal energy output distribution has become quite a challenge for the construction team. If we want to ensure the smoothness of the construction, we must replace all the damaged equipments.\n\nProblems like this are however likely going to keep repeating unless we find the root cause of the problem, but that'll require extra efforts on our science team.
acot_herculean_events.400.a = Spare no expenses.
acot_herculean_events.400.a.explain = Extra resources will be allocated to continue construction.
acot_herculean_events.400.b = Tell them to fix their own mess.
acot_herculean_events.400.b.explain = The Team will have to rely on their own budgets and skills to fix the problem, setting back some progress on the construction by 180 days.
acot_herculean_events.400.c = Unacceptable, replace the crew.
acot_herculean_events.400.c.explain = The current construction crew will be replaced. Construction will be paused for 360 days while a new team is assembled.
acot_herculean_events.400.d = We must fix the root problem.
acot_herculean_events.400.d.explain = Begins a project to study the problem behind power failures and hopefully fix it.
acot_herculean_events.400.e = That's it. We're cancelling the project.
acot_herculean_events.400.e.explain = We have barely even begun the project and it's already filled with tons of issues. Perhaps it is for the best that we stop it now before this becomes a massive waste of time and resources.
ACOT_HERCULEAN_POWER_FAILURE_FIX = Herculean Power Failure
ACOT_HERCULEAN_POWER_FAILURE_FIX_DESC = These constant power failures are unacceptable. We must go back to the drawing board and track the root cause of the problem.
acot_herculean_events.401.name = Problem Solved!
acot_herculean_events.401.desc = Our science team has finally determined the root cause of the Herculean's power failure issues. The fault lies with our misconception of how the power reactor of the Herculean follows an entirely different concept compared to any known reactor we are familiar with. This is an oversight on translation error of our deciphers, for what powers the Herculean is no mere power reactor, but a heart, one that must be given proper DAI to regulate its flow of energy and allow the Heart to "rest" when not in used.\n\nA proper design has already been installed, and we are confident that as we improve our design, the future literation of the Heart will be more stable and require less regulation.
acot_herculean_events.401.a = Excellent work.
acot_herculean_events.402.name = Incoming Transmission.
acot_herculean_events.402.desc.a = Greetings, [root.GetName]! The Curator Order is interested to observe the development of your new project, this Herculean, we take it? While we have little understanding of the concept, the scale seems to be quite remarkable and its an ancient precursor design to boot. We're hoping to assign some of our own scientists and technicians to observe and assist in the project.\n\nNaturally, you will be compensated for this, and any expertises we may provided will be yours as well.
acot_herculean_events.402.desc.b = Greetings, [root.GetName]! Though you have previously attacked one of our bastion unprovoked, the Curator Order is willing to pardon your offense. In exchange, we wish to observe the development of your new project, this Herculean, we take it? Such colossal undertaking of ancient precursor design is, alone,  worthy of records in the archive. In exchange, our assigned memebers will also offer their expertises as needed.
acot_herculean_events.402.a = Gladly.
acot_herculean_events.402.a.response = We knew we can count on you, [root.GetRulerTitle]! Regardless of the outcome, this will be a event worthy of preserving in the historical records!
acot_herculean_events.402.b = We cannot compromise our security. Not even to you.
acot_herculean_events.402.b.response = That is a shame, but we understand. This clearly must be a very important project. We will not press our request further, and will await in anticipation for the project's conclusion.
acot_herculean_events.402.c = Very well. We accept your offer.
acot_herculean_events.402.c.response = Excellent! The Curator Order will re-open our services back to your empire effectively immediately. Our science team will be transferred to your project now.
acot_herculean_events.402.d = We are not interested.
acot_herculean_events.402.d.response = Ah, how unfortunate. We will not press you and your kind further then.
acot_herculean_events.403.name = Incoming Transmission.
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.spirit.a = Amusing. One would expect the plebeians to know better. You're trying to build an object that which even the most gifted elders could not. It is the instrument of divinity, based upon the old gods of this cosmos. You will find no success in this endeavor.\n\nAbandon your mad scheme now, and spare yourselves from shame and defeat.
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.spirit.b = Ah, such innocent youngling. You're no doubt trying to imitate our ancestors in trying to build this Herculean. We admire your enthusiasm, but you are not ready for this. Nor is it your duty to do so, your role as a Scion is to pass down OUR legacy, as we did for our ancestors. Naught else should be your concern.\n\nAbandon this foolish quest, my child. Return to correct path, the path of eternal legacy. You still have many tomes of eld to be studied before you can become the new Holy Guardian of the Faith.
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.mat.a = Will you primitives never learn? Again and again, you toy with technologies you do not understand.\n\nListen and obey. The Herculean Project failed because every projected calculations suggest they will never uphold the standards of their creators. What if a thousand year from now, after your civilization is nothing but bones and ashes, your foolish toy commit crimes of untold proportions? Do you think we have so much free time as to fix your mess?\n\nBut who am I kidding, it's not like you will find success in it anyway. So let's spare this galaxy one more pointless event, and learn to control your ambition.
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.mat.b = [root.GetName], you have come far under as scion of our great empire. But it appears you have forgotton your role. In trying to build the Herculean Project, you're violating your sacred charge that defines your status as a Scion. You are to uphold our legacy, and when the time comes, rise to moderate the galaxy's progression. Your project not only defiles that charge due to its nature, but also itself is a dangerous technology.\n\nBut there is still time to correct this error, abandon the project and all will be given in time.
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.phile.a = What is this? A Herculean?\n\n\n\nAhahaha...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nYou can't be serious! You actually believe in that myth? Oh, poor, poor little [root.GetSpeciesName]. A tool to preserve your legacy? Why bother with that, we already do that for you, little one.\n\nJust give up now, it will be less embarassing that way when you realize you are chasing after a dumb fairy tale.
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.phobe.a = Why do you primitive xenos love to cause needless complications? Another Herculean project attempt? Hmph...such arrogance.\n\nAlthough you stand little chance of finishing it, it will be foolish of us to ignore this potential threat. You will cease this project at once, or we will cease it for you.
acot_herculean_events.403.a = That is none of your business.
acot_herculean_events.403.a.response = It is not your business to decide what is our business, primitive. We will be watching.
acot_herculean_events.403.b = Just leave us be.
acot_herculean_events.403.b.response = Yellow, we knew it. Very well, we will enjoy watching you fail. Have a nice day.
acot_herculean_events.403.c = We obey. The Herculean Project will cease immediately.
acot_herculean_events.403.c.response = Hah! The primitive speak senses for once! This alone is a miracle. Shame the Curators are not here to record it.
acot_herculean_events.5.name = Herculean: The Heart
acot_herculean_events.5.desc = The heart of the Herculean has been successfully constructed. At first glance, it bears striking resemblances to the ancient colossus utilized by the Fallen Ones. After all, the Colossus was simply a downscaled, simplified version of the Heart, repurposed to the simpliest design as a WMD.\n\nBut this heart, our heart is different. Within it bears countless amount of complex intelligences, working in unison to uphold the tenants and legacy of our empire. While truly a remarkable piece of technology, the Herculean is defenseless against external threats. It is recommended that a sizable garrison be placed here to deal with potential unforeseen consequences.
acot_herculean_events.5.a = We must remain vigilant
acot_herculean_events.5.b = Our expansion grows larger
acot_herculean_events.502.name = Incoming Transmission.
acot_herculean_events.502.desc = Your Herculean Construction Project seems to be going well, [root.GetName]. Although the Curator Order is honored to be part of it, we fear that we have very little to offer in the project, as it goes way beyond our expertise.\n\nThat said, if you still wish to have us, perhaps we can offer our very own labotory design and schematics that can be installed on board the Herculean Science Department Section. To offer our sincerity, we offer this service free of charge. We just want to be part of this epoch in the making.
acot_herculean_events.502.a = We'd be honored.
acot_herculean_events.502.a.response = We knew we can count on you, [root.GetRulerTitle]! Regardless of the outcome, this will be a event worthy of preserving in the historical records!
acot_herculean_events.502.b = Sadly, this breeches our security's protocol.
acot_herculean_events.502.b.response = That is a shame, but we understand. According to our own analysis, it appears none has succeed in completing this project in the ages past, and sabotage was one of the many reasons. We will not press our request further, and will await in anticipation for the project's conclusion. Should you change your mind, please do not hesitate to contact us.
acot_herculean_events.502.c = If you can't help us with the project, then you have no place here.
acot_herculean_events.502.c.response = We understand your disappointment. It is wrong of us to promise something we have no way of keeping. Very well, we will withdraw all of our staffs effectively immediately. May you find success in your project.
acot_herculean_events.6.name = Herculean: The Shell
acot_herculean_events.6.desc = The exterior shell has been installed which will not only serve to protect the vessel, but also acts as the network where legions of ships can be made and launched from the massive hard-light facilities. Initial projection states that the Herculean can support over eighty ship production simultaneously.\n\nOur military leaders are no longer concerned about the possibility of project cancellation, now they are beginning to consider what the Herculean can do once its fully operational.
acot_herculean_events.6.a = We will establish ourselves as the legends of this galaxy.
acot_herculean_events.6.b = Of course, to vanquish all those who oppose us.
acot_herculean_events.7.name = Herculean: The Pillars

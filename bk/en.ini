It then proceeded to walk around the plain for the next few hours, encountering only a few sparse Solakian settlements.\n\nThis visibly exasperated the creature, which let out what we could only assume was a sigh before suddenly vanishing again in a bright flash of light, much to the stupefaction of Solakian locals.\n\nThe observation post was unfortunately unable to gather any more information regarding this being, as it seems the Flusionians are just as confused as we are when it comes to the nature of this peculiar visitor...

Most Paluushians regard the work as a necessary chore, but one Paluushian by the name of §YSparkbun§! appears to treat the excursions as a sort of self-finding vacation. He remarks that over the many long years of stalemate, it's been difficult to truly understand the scope of Paluushian progress, but in this war his might cannot be opposed. It seems to be an eye-opening moment for him, and when he returns home he makes many passionate speeches about the future potential of Paluushia.\n\nThe war between Katzenland and Nienet dragged on. Their planets suffering, the two sides met to discuss a potential armistice. Dignitaries from the Blokkat and Paluushian empires were both invited to offer input using their legendary future-seeing abilities. The Blokkats counseled a cease-fire, but the Paluushian dignitary, a seer by the name of §YPoh'tin§! foresaw that this would lead to economic hardship, and more importantly to his own nation, an era of exploitative trade in benefit of the Blokkats.\n\nPoh'tin proclaimed that the only satisfactory way to resolve the conflict was a complete and total victory over one side. Poh'tin had envisioned this as a successful war effort guided by Paluushian heroes, leveraged into a hegemony thereafter. However, much to the Paluush's dismay, Katzenland and Nienet's leaderships eventually ended up realizing the futility and danger posed by the war, leading to the establishment of a Blokkat-counseled ceasefire and the slow but steady mending of the relations between the two worlds.\n\nJust as Sparkbun had been impressed upon by the war and the importance of stern diplomacy, Poh'tin walked away from this disaster questioning his role. Amid Sparkbun's calls to greatness, Poh'tin began to question the basic practicality of the Paluushian seer system. He argued their clairvoyance was now so wound up in predicting futures that their empire would never realize, that it was possible they were overlooking basic common-sense and simple deductive reasoning.\n\nThe Paluushians would get the chance to test his doubts when their seers foresaw an ominous military threat. Poh'tin argued that this foe was likely capable of reason, and if the Paluushians prepared for diplomacy and co-existence, there was a chance of peace. His words proved deeply unpopular among the embittered Paluushins, and he was cast aside in favor of Sparkbun's call to arms.\n\nThe invading force was an empire of genocidal machines known as "§YRabbots§!", which were not interested, if even capable, of coexistence. They attacked the Blokkat communication networks and disrupted their power grids, while the Paluushian psychic infrastructure was beyond their understanding. The Blokkats buckled, and were forced into a bloody, mass-exodus from the planet. The Paluushians carried on, their morale now skyrocketed, until the Rabbots were in ruins, vindicating Sparkbun while leaving the credibility of Poh'tin in shambles.\n\nYet, though the Blokkats fled the planet here, this isn't where the records on the Blokkats end.

While Poh'tin was hoping the Paluush would be able to help the Katzens achieve victory, Katzenland eventually ended up employing the nuclear option and incinerated Nienet in nuclear hellfire in a matter of minutes. While such an act would have normally led to the collapse of the Katzen regime, it strangely only reinforced the popularity of the Katzen government and meant Paluush aid had become obsolete, leading to the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Katzen and Paluush leaderships.\n\nJust as Sparkbun had been impressed upon by the war and the importance of stern diplomacy, Poh'tin walked away from this disaster questioning his role.

giga_blokkat.3321.nokatzens.desc = At last, our scientists believe they're reached the end of this tumultuous story! It seems that as the Paluushians made their return to Paluushia, they neglected their heavy industry, intent as they were to return to their idyllic lives under the watch of the Grandbunny. The Blokkats were meanwhile sweeping up behind them.\n\nInstead of colonizing the Paluushian worlds, the Blokkats simply scooped factory parts up and returned them to Neoblokatina, expanding the ringworld out, adding more wings, more rings - ever expanding manufacturing to feed their manufacturing. It must have appeared to the Blokkats that fortunes were finally turning in their favor for the first time since departing Paluushia, and had they taken merely these gifts alone, all may have been well.\n\nAs the Paluushians began to demilitarize their great war fleets, they must have seemed too juicy a target to the Blokkats. We cannot say what they were thinking for sure. Perhaps the Blokkats believed the Paluushians were suffering some massive disaster. Regardless, they used their salvaged foundries to produce a war fleet and rallied it towards Paluushia.\n\nBased on observation, it seems that part of the Blokkat fleet involved a precursor to the harvesting technology they possess today. They were intent on breaking down, and then reclaiming the Paluushian civilization. Sadly for them, until this moment, they had never met the actual Grandbunny. In the Blokkats' old media broadcasts, she had always been depicted as a backwards and ridiculous god the Paluushians believed in; a clownish figure who did not exist.\n\nWhen the Blokkat fleets arrived over Paluushia, initially bolstered by the fact that the fleets of Gatzo's inhabitants refused to engage despite the Blokkats being trespassing within Katzen territory, they were proven woefully wrong. The Grandbunny's actions are definitely fatal, but our researchers have difficulty describing it. This is exacerbated by the psionic archives imprinting the sense of having actually been there. To quote the lead archeologist:\n\n"Well, she raises up her hands, and the Blokkat fleets start flying backwards, right? And then I guess they sort of… turn inside out, so they're flying right-ways again. And then there's this thing with a scrum worm. Do you know what a scrum worm is? Neither do I. But what it is, it's definitely a scrum worm. You just know. Definitely a scrum worm. And this. Well, it - it's rather hard to explain, but it sort of... - it - it scrums, see?"\n\nAnd apparently this destroyed the fleet in such a horrific fashion that those Blokkats just outside the "scrum" event made an emergency escape from the battle. Shortly thereafter, the Blokkats complete the astounding engineering feat of building gargantuan engines into Neoblokatina, and they fly Neoblokatina away from Paluushia at full thrust, towards the edge of galactic space. Our scientists believe the Blokkats must have been terrified of having Neoblokatina be "scrummed".\n\nBeyond this point, we find no more material related to the Blokkats. Since they are here now, it is evident that they must have escaped the galaxy, greatly advanced their technological progress, and chose only now to return. At the outset of all this, we never may have anticipated they originated from within our own galactic area! Much less could we have guessed at the complicated role the Paluushians played in their development both culturally and technologically. This invaluable gathering of information will surely benefit our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§!.

According to intercepted transmissions, he is intending to convert the structure into a so-called §YAscension Engine§!, a gargantuan device enabling Pouchkinn to ascend to a higher plane of existence.\n\nEerily enough, Pouchkinn shows no interest in elevating the rest of his civilization, having reduced his brethren to lethargic and unsuspecting hedonists, presumably to get them out of his way.\n\nShould Pouchkinn be allowed to completed his device, our scientists have concluded that, while not drastic enough to outright end the galaxy, the subspace feedback caused by Pouchkinn breaching the fabric of the universe would §Rdisrupt and rearrange every hyperlane in the galaxy§! as well as §Rcause significant damage to colonies and FTL comms networks§!.\n\nAssuming Pouchkinn is not stopped, it is estimated that we have about §Y25 years§! before the Engine is completed.
